      "The Bhagavad Gita, or the song of God, was revealed by Lord Shree Krishna to Arjun on the threshold of the epic war of Mahabharata. A decisive battle between two sets of cousins, the Kauravas and the Pandavas, was just about to commence on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. A detailed account of the reasons that led to such a colossal war; is given under Introduction-The Setting of the Bhagavad Gita.",
      "The Bhagavad Gita is primarily a conversation between Lord Shree Krishna and Arjun. However, the first chapter begins with a dialogue between King Dhritarashtra and his minister Sanjay. Dhritarashtra being blind, could not leave his palace in Hastinapur but was eager to know the ongoings of the battlefield. Sanjay was a disciple of Sage Ved Vyas, the author of the epic Mahabharata and several other Hindu scriptures. Sage Ved Vyas possessed a mystic ability to see and hear events occurring in distant places. He had bestowed upon Sanjay the miraculous power of distant vision. Therefore, Sanjay could see and hear what transpired on the battleground of Kurukshetra, and gave a first-hand account to King Dhritarashtra, while still being in his palace."

Several warriors including Draupadi’s five sons were killed in this attack. The Pandavas, along with Draupadi and Shree Krishna were away that night. When they returned to the camp, they were devasted. Arjun went after Ashwatthama, caught him and threw him at the feet of Draupadi, who was grieving the death of her young sons. Bheem was raged and wanted to kill Ashwatthama right way, but Draupadi was a soft-hearted lady of forgiving nature. She said that Ashwatthama was their Guru Drona’s son and a Brahmin, therefore, they should forgive him. Arjun was unsure what to do next and wanted guidance from Shree Krishna, who then said, “A respect-worthy Brahmin must be forgiven even if he may have temporarily fallen from virtue.  But a person who approaches to kill with a lethal weapon must certainly be punished.”  Arjun understood what the Lord meant; he did not kill Ashwatthama. Instead, he cut his brahmin’s tuft, removed the jewel of immense power from his forehead, and let him go.",

      "In this chapter, Arjun reiterates to Shree Krishna that he is unable to cope with his current situation, where he has to kill his elders and teachers. He refuses to take part in such a battle and requests Shree Krishna to be his spiritual teacher and guide him on the proper path of action. Then the Supreme Lord starts imparting divine knowledge to Arjun. He begins with the immortal-nature of the soul, which is eternal and imperishable. Death only destroys the physical body, but the soul continues its journey.  Just as a person discards his old clothes and adorns new ones, the soul keeps changing bodies from one lifetime to another.",
      "The Lord then reminds Arjun that his social responsibility as a warrior is to fight for upholding righteousness. He explains that performing one’s social duty is a virtuous act that can take him to the celestial abodes, while dereliction only leads to infamy and humiliation.",
      "At first, Shree Krishna tries to motivate Arjun at a mundane level. Then he moves deeper and starts explaining to Arjun the Science of Work. He asks Arjun to perform his deeds without any attachment to their fruits. This science of working without desire for rewards is called the yog of the intellect or Buddhi-Yog. He further advises that the intellect should be used to control the desire for rewards from work. By working with such intent, the bondage-creating karmas get transformed into bondage-breaking karmas and a state beyond sorrows can be attained.",
      "Arjun is curious to know more about those who are situated in divine consciousness. Shree Krishna, therefore, describes how persons who have attained transcendence are free from attachment, fear, and anger. They are undisturbed and equipoised in every situation. With their senses subdued, they keep their minds always absorbed in God. He also explains the progression of afflictions of the mind—such as greed, anger, lust, etc. and advises how these can be overcome."

The other is the material compassion that we feel upon seeing the bodily distress of others.  Material compassion is a noble sentiment that is not perfectly directed.  It is like being obsessed with the health of the car while the driver sitting within is famished for food.  Arjun is experiencing this second kind of sentiment.  He is overwhelmed with material pity toward his enemies gathered for battle.  The fact that Arjun is overcome by grief and despair shows that he is himself in dire need of compassion.  Therefore, the idea of his being merciful upon others is meaningless.",

Bheeshma was the embodiment of chastity, and remained a lifelong celibate to fulfill the vow he had made to his father.  Arjun’s military preceptor, Dronacharya, was a genius in the science of warfare, and it was from him that Arjun mastered the art of archery.  Kripacharya was another respectable person on the other side, whom Arjun had always held in veneration.  To treat these men of high merit as enemies now seemed abominable to the noble-minded Arjun.  If even arguing with these venerable elders was improper, then how could he ever think of attacking them with weapons?  His statement thus implies, “O Krishna, please do not doubt my courage.  I am prepared to fight.  But from the perspective of moral duty, my duty is to respect my teachers and to show compassion to the sons of Dhritarashtra.”",

Macbeth got swayed by her advice and assassinated the king, and thereafter, he and Lady Macbeth were crowned as the king and queen of Scotland. However, for years after that, Macbeth would be found walking in his palace, fully awake at night. The author writes, “Macbeth hath killed sleep, and so Macbeth shall sleep no more.” The queen would be found repeatedly washing her hands, as if to remove imaginary blood stains. In this verse, Arjun commiserates that, if he did kill these noble elders, tainted with their blood, his conscience would not let him enjoy all the royal benefits of ruling the kingdom.",

By taking the side of adharma (unrighteousness), he showed that even the biggest forces on heaven and earth could not make unholiness win in this holy war.

He performed this leela for our benefit, to teach by his example that we souls, who are under the influence of Maya, will need a Guru to dispel our ignorance. In this verse, Arjun takes the step of surrendering to Shree Krishna as his disciple, and requests his Guru to enlighten him regarding the proper course of action.",

It is estimated that within seven years, practically all the cells of the body change. Further, the molecules within the cells change even more rapidly. With every breath we inhale, oxygen molecules are absorbed into our cells via the metabolic processes, and molecules that were heretofore locked within the cells are released as carbon dioxide. Scientists estimate that in one year’s time, about ninety-eight percent of our bodily molecules change. And yet, despite the continual change of the body, we perceive that we are the same person.

In ancient classical Western religious and philosophic circles, famous thinkers such as Pythagoras, Plato, and Socrates accepted reincarnation to be true, and their views were also reflected in Orphism, Hermeticism, Neoplatonism, Manicheanism, and Gnosticism. Within the mainstream Abrahamic faiths, mystics of the three major religions also supported reincarnation. Examples include Jews who studied the Kabbalah, the Christian Cathars, and Muslim Shia sects such as the Alawi Shias and the Druze. For example, amongst Occidental religions, Josephus, the great ancient Jewish historian, used language in his writings that seem to ascribe belief in some form of reincarnation among the Pharisees and Essenes of his day.

However, there are occasions where the rules change and even violence becomes necessary. For example, in cases where a snake is approaching to bite, or if one is attacked with lethal weapons, or one’s life sustenance is being snatched away, then violence is permitted for self-protection. In the present situation, what is appropriate for Arjun, violence or non-violence, and why? Shree Krishna will explain this to him in great detail, as the dialogue of the Bhagavad Gita progresses.

These are Mīmānsā, Vedānt, Nyāya, Vaiśheṣhik, Sānkhya, and Yog. Within each of these are more branches—for example, the Vedānt school of thought is further divided into six schools—Adavita vāda, Dwaita vāda, Viśhiṣhṭādvaita vāda, Viśhuddhadvaita vāda, Dwaitādvaita vāda, and Achintya-bhedābheda vāda. Each of these has further branches, for example, Advaita vāda is subdivided into Dṛiṣhṭi-sṛiṣhṭi vāda, Avachchheda vāda, Bimba-pratibimba vāda, Vivarta vāda, Ajāta vāda, etc. We will not go into the details of these schools here.

Chārvāka vāda states that the body itself comprises the self, and consciousness is merely a product of the conglomeration of its constituents. Jainism states that the soul is the same size as the body, and hence, it is subject to change from birth to birth.

The yakṣha pulled him in. After some time when Bheem did not return, a concerned Yudhishthir sent Arjun to see what was happening and fetch water. When Arjun reached the well, the yakṣha asked him too, “I have already seized your brother. Do not attempt to draw the water unless you can answer all my questions correctly.” Arjun also paid no heed, and the yakṣha pulled him into the well. The other brothers, Nakul and Sahadev, followed him, but met with the same fate. Finally, Yudhishthir himself came to the well. Once again, the yakṣha said, “Answer my questions if you want to drink water from the well, or I will pull you in, just as I have done to your four brothers.” Yudhisthir agreed to answer the questions. The yakṣha was actually the celestial God of death, Yamraj, in disguise. He asked sixty questions, each of which was answered perfectly by Yudhishthir. One of these questions was: kim āśhcharyaṁ? “What is the most surprising thing in this world?” Yudhisthir replied:",

It lists twenty-four entities: pañch-mahābhūta (earth, water, fire, air, and sky), pañch tanmātrā (the five abstract qualities of matter—taste, touch, smell, sound, and sight), pañch karmendriya (five working senses), pañch jñānendriya (five knowledge senses), mind, ahankār (the entity created by the evolution of mahān), mahān (the entity created by evolution of prakṛiti), prakṛiti (the primordial form of the material energy).

Hence, Shree Krishna has interestingly called it buddhi yog, or “Yog of the Intellect.” In subsequent verses (2.41 and 2.44), he goes on to explain how the intellect plays an important role in bringing the mind to a state of detachment.",

If the intellect decides that prestige is the most important thing in life, the mind craves for reputation and fame. In other words, the mind develops desires in accordance with the knowledge of the intellect.",

Yet, we adopt appropriate formal postures while sitting in the office. It is not that the mind enjoys the formality of the office—given its way, it would rather embrace the informality of home. However, the intellect decides that formal behavior is necessary in the office. So the intellect controls the mind, and people sit formally all day long, following the decorum of the workplace, against the nature of the mind. Similarly, the mind does not enjoy doing office work—if it had its way, it would rather sit at home and watch television. But the intellect rules that working in office is necessary to earn a living. Therefore, the intellect again reins in the natural tendency of the mind, and people work eight hours a day, or longer.",

Thus, we must cultivate the intellect with proper knowledge and use it to guide the mind in the proper direction.

Such a person of resolute intellect cultivates single-minded focus on the goal, and traverses the path like an arrow released from the bow. This resolve becomes so strong in higher stages of sādhanā that nothing can deter the sādhak from treading the path. He or she thinks, “Even if there are millions of obstacles on my path, even if the whole world condemns me, even if I have to lay down my life, I will still not give up my sādhanā.” But those whose intellect is many-branched find their mind running in various directions.

He instructs Arjun never to chase after preconceived motives attached to his actions nor consider himself as the cause of the results of his actions. However, when we perform actions, then why should we not consider ourselves as the doers of those actions? The reason is that our senses, mind, and intellect are inert; God energizes them with his power and puts them at our disposal. As a result, only with the help of the power we receive from him, are we able to work. For example, the tongs in the kitchen are inactive by themselves, but they get energized by someone’s hand, and then they perform even difficult tasks, such as lifting burning coal, etc. Now if we say that the tongs are the doers of actions, it will be inaccurate. If the hand did not energize them, what would they be able to do? They would merely lie inert on the table. Similarly, if God did not supply our body-mind-soul mechanism with the power to perform actions, we could have done nothing. Thus, we must give up the ego of doing, remembering that God is the only source of the power by which we perform all our actions.",

Shree Krishna explains that working without personal motivation does not reduce the quality of our work; instead we become even more skillful than before. Consider the example of a sincere surgeon who cuts people with his knife while operating upon them. He performs his duty with equanimity, and is undisturbed irrespective of whether the patient survives or dies. This is because he is merely doing his duty unselfishly, to the best of his ability, and is not attached to the results. Hence, even if the patient dies while being operated upon, the surgeon does not feel guilty of murder. However, if the same surgeon’s only child needs to be operated, he does not have the courage to do so. Because of attachment to the results, he fears he will not be able to perform the operation skillfully, and so he seeks the help of another surgeon. This shows that attachment to results does not make us more skillful; rather, the attachment affects our performance adversely. Instead, if we work without attachment, we can do so at our maximum skill level, without feeling nervous, jittery, scared, tense, or excited.",

Saubhari had attained such control over his body that he used to submerge himself in the river Yamuna and meditate under water. One day, he saw two fish mating. This sight carried away his mind and senses, and the desire for sexual association arose in him. He abandoned his spiritual practice and came out of the water, wondering how to fulfill his desire.",

I shall bring my fifty daughters before you, and whosoever chooses you will become yours in marriage.” The king was confident that none of his daughters would choose the old ascetic, and in this way, he would be saved from the sage’s curse.",

In this manner, thousands of years passed by. The Puranas state that Saubhari had many children from each of them, and those children had further children, until a tiny city had been created. One day, Saubhari came to his senses, and exclaimed, aho imaṁ paśhyata me vināśhaṁ (Bhāgavatam 9.6.50) [v51] “O humans! Those of you, who make plans to attain happiness through material acquisitions, be careful. Look at my degradation—where I was and where am I now. I created fifty bodies by my yogic powers, and lived with fifty women for thousands of years. And yet, the senses did not experience fulfillment; they only kept hankering for more.

One day one boy notices something about one girl and starts thinking, “I would be very happy if she were mine.” As he continuously repeats this thought in his mind, his mind becomes attached to her. He tells his friends that he is madly in love with her, and he is unable to study because his mind repeatedly goes to her. His friends ridicule him that they all interact with her in class, but none of them is crazy about her. Why is he losing his sleep and ruining his studies because of her?

When the mind is free from both attachment and aversion, and is absorbed in devotion to God, one receives the grace of God and experiences his unlimited divine bliss. On experiencing that higher taste, the mind no longer feels attracted to the sense objects, even while using them. Thus, even while tasting, touching, smelling, hearing, and seeing, like all of us, the sthita prajña is free from both attachment and aversion.",

By God’s grace, when we experience the higher taste of divine bliss, the agitation for sensual happiness is extinguished. Once that hankering for material objects ceases, one goes beyond all suffering and the mind becomes tranquil. In that state of internal fulfillment, the intellect becomes firm in its decision that God alone is the source of happiness and is the final goal of the soul. Previously, the intellect was accepting this only on the basis of knowledge as stated in the scriptures, but now it gets the experience of perfect peace and divine bliss.

While they suck its nectar, the flower closes at night, and they get trapped within it. Fish are trapped by the desire for eating, and they swallow the bait of the fishermen. Insects are drawn to light. They come too close to the fire and get burnt. The weakness of elephants is the sense of touch. The hunter uses this to trap the male elephant by using the female elephant as bait to draw it into the pit. On entering the pit to touch the female, the male elephant is unable to get out, and is killed by the hunter. All these creatures get drawn toward their death by one of their senses. What then will be the fate of a human being who enjoys the objects of all the five senses?” In this verse, Shree Krishna warns Arjun of the power of these senses in leading the mind astray.",

He would stand in his room, resting on a hanging rope under his armpits. He used the rope to help him remain in the standing position. On being asked what his motivation was for this destructive kind of austerity, he would quote this verse of the Bhagavad Gita: “What all beings see as night, the enlightened sage sees as day.” So to practice it, he had given up sleeping at night.

      "Shree Krishna expounds Karm Yog or the Yog of Action in this chapter. He explains to Arjun that nobody can remain without action, even for a moment. Bound by their inherent modes of nature, all beings are always engaged in some work. Superior are those who practice Karm Yog and continue to work diligently to fulfill their responsibilities externally, but internally they are unattached to them. However, the hypocrites display external renunciation but internally dwell upon the objects of their senses.",
      "Shree Krishna says that all living beings are an integral part of God’s creation and have roles and responsibilities to fulfill. Vedas prescribe performing yajña to please the celestial gods, who in-return bestow material gains. These yajñas cause rains to fall, which aids in the production of food grains for the sustenance of life on earth. Those who live only for the delight of their senses and do not accept their responsibility in this cycle— are sinful and living in vain. However, Shree Krishna says that when works or prescribed duties are performed as an obligation to God, they are also considered yajña (sacrifice).",
      "He then explains that unlike the rest of the humankind, the enlightened souls are not obliged to fulfill their bodily responsibilities. They are situated in knowledge of the self and execute higher responsibilities of the soul. However, they do not abandon their social duties, as it may create disharmony in the minds of the common people who look up to them for inspiration. Therefore, the wise continue to work without any personal motive only to set good examples for others to follow, else, the ignorant may abandon their prescribed duties prematurely. Shree Krishna mentions one such example of the enlightened King Janak, who performed his earthly duties as an ideal king and father.",
      "Arjun then asks Shree Krishna why people commit sin, even when unwilling, as if by some force. Lord Krishna explains that lust alone is the sinful all-devouring enemy. Similar to a fire that is covered by smoke or a mirror covered in dust, desire shrouds one’s knowledge and deludes the intellect. In the end, Shree Krishna advises Arjun that by controlling the senses, mind, and intellect—one can slay this enemy called desire, which is an embodiment of sin."

In chapter two, the Lord first explained knowledge of the immortal self. He then reminded Arjun of his duty as a warrior, and said that performing it would result in glory and the celestial abodes. After prodding Arjun to do his occupational work as a Kshatriya, Shree Krishna then revealed a superior principle—the science of karm yog—and asked Arjun to detach himself from the fruits of his works. In this way, bondage-creating karmas would be transformed into bondage-breaking karmas. He termed the science of working without desire for rewards as buddhi yog, or Yog of the intellect. By this, he meant that the mind should be detached from worldly temptations by controlling it with a resolute intellect; and the intellect should be made unwavering through the cultivation of spiritual knowledge. He did not suggest that actions should be given up, but rather that attachment to the fruits of actions should be given up.",

Hence, he tells Arjun that complete inactivity is impossible even for a moment. If we simply sit down, it is an activity; if we lie down, that is also an activity; if we fall asleep, the mind is still engaged in dreaming; even in deep sleep, the heart and other bodily organs are functioning. Thus Shree Krishna declares that for human beings inactivity is an impossible state to reach, since the body-mind-intellect mechanism is compelled by its own make-up of the three guṇas (sattva, rajas, and tamas) to perform work in the world.

As Shakespeare said: “For there is nothing good or bad, but thinking makes it so.” Similarly, work in itself is neither good nor bad. Depending upon the state of the mind, it can be either binding or elevating. Work done for the enjoyment of one’s senses and the gratification of one’s pride is the cause of bondage in the material world, while work performed as yajña (sacrifice) for the pleasure of the Supreme Lord liberates one from the bonds of Maya and attracts divine grace. Since it is our nature to perform actions, we are forced to work in one of the two modes. We cannot remain without working for even a moment as our mind cannot remain still.",

Let us say, we walk into someone’s house, and without recognizing the owner, we sit on the sofa, eat from the refrigerator, and use the restroom. We may claim that we are not doing anything wrong, but we will be considered thieves in the eyes of the law, because the house does not belong to us.

Such periods become golden eras in the social and cultural history of humankind. Conversely, when a major section of humankind begins to violate the universal system and rejects its responsibility as an integral part of the cosmic system, then material nature begins to punish, and peace and prosperity become scarce.",

Such escapists cite the instances of the great karm sanyāsīs, such as Shankaracharya, Madhvacharya, Nimbarkacharya, and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Following their lofty footsteps, these imposters also renounce worldly duties and take sanyās, even though they have not yet attained the purity of mind required for it. In India, we find thousands of such sadhus. They copy the examples of the great sanyāsīs and don the ochre robes, without the concurrent internal enlightenment and bliss. Though externally renounced, their nature forces them to seek happiness, and devoid of the divine bliss of God, they begin indulging in the lowly pleasure of intoxication.

Now, if there is any accident, it is not the horses that are blamed, but the driver who was directing them. Similarly, the soul is held responsible for the actions of the mind-body mechanism because the senses-mind-intellect work on receiving inspiration from the soul.",

They find it difficult to resist this force of habit and nature. If the Vedic scriptures instructed them to give up all works and engage in pure spirituality, it would create an unstable situation. Such artificial repression would be counter-productive. The proper and easier way for spiritual advancement is to utilize the immense force of habit and tendencies and dovetail it in the direction of God.

Thus, lust shows itself in many ways—the urge for money, physical cravings, craving for prestige, the drive for power, etc. This lust is only a perverted reflection of love for God, which is the inherent nature of every living being. When the soul associates with the material energy in the form of the body, its divine love for God is transformed into lust, in association with the mode of passion. Since divine love is the highest power of God, its perversion in the material realm, which is lust, is also the most powerful force in worldly activities.",

When desire is satisfied, it gives birth to greed; when it is not satisfied, it gives rise to anger. One commits sins under the influence of all three—lust, greed, and anger. Greed is nothing but intensified desire, while anger is frustrated desire. Hence, Shree Krishna labels lust, or desire, as the root of all evil.",

He turned around to walk out of the forest, but to his dismay he found that animals had gathered on the other side. These ferocious animals started chasing him and to escape from them, he ran deeper into the forest. While running, he found a witch standing in front of him with open arms to embrace him. To escape her, he turned direction and ran perpendicular to the animals and the witch. By then, it had become dark. Unable to see much, he ran over a ditch that was covered by vine hanging from a tree. He fell headlong, but his feet became entangled in the vine. As a result, he began hanging upside down above the ditch. After a few moments he came to his senses and saw a snake sitting at the bottom of the ditch, waiting to bite him if he fell down. In the meantime, two mice appeared—one white and one black—and started nibbling at the branch from which the vine was hanging. To confound his problems, some wasps gathered and began stinging him on his face. In this precarious situation, it was found that the man was smiling. Philosophers gathered to ponder how he could smile in such a dire strait. They looked upwards and found a beehive, from which honey was dripping onto his tongue. He was licking the honey and thinking how pleasurable it was; he had forgotten the animals, the witch, the snake, the mice, and the wasps.",

The witch represented old age that is waiting to embrace us with the passage of time. The snake at the bottom of the pit is like the inevitable death that awaits us all. The white and black mice that were nibbling on the branch represent day and night, which are steadily reducing our life and bringing us closer to death. The wasps that were stinging the face are like the innumerable desires that arise in the mind and agitate it, causing us pain and distress. Honey represents the sensual enjoyment we experience in the world, which clouds the discrimination of our intellect.

      "To strengthen Arjun’s faith in the knowledge He is imparting, Shree Krishna reveals His pristine origin in this chapter. He says, “Arjun, as you are my devotee and a dear friend, I am revealing this supreme science of Yog to you. It is the same eternal science that I taught to the Sun God at the beginning of time. And in a continuous tradition, the same knowledge was passed to the saintly kings.” Arjun wonders how someone who is almost his age could exist so many eons ago. He asks Shree Krishna how is it possible that you gave this knowledge to the Sun God and the others so many years back in time. To clarify Arjun’s doubts, Shree Krishna discloses the divine mystery of his descension. He says that although God is unborn and eternal, it is to establish dharma (the path of righteousness) that He descends on this earth by His Yogmaya power. His birth and activities are divine and cannot get tainted by material imperfections. Once a devotee knows this secret and engages in devotion with great faith, he attains God and does not take birth in this world again.",
      "Shree Krishna then continues to explain the nature of work and its three principles: action, in-action, and forbidden action. He explains—how the karm yogis, even while performing the most engaging task, are in the state of inaction and do not get entangled in the karmic reactions of such action. Knowing this—the ancient sages performed all their work as an act of sacrifice for the pleasure of God. They were not affected by happiness, distress, success, or failure. He explains that when sacrifice is suitably dedicated, performed with proper knowledge and pure sentiments, then its remnants become like nectar. And by partaking such nectar, the devotees are cleansed of all impurities. Even the biggest sinner can cross over the ocean of material miseries by boarding this boat of eternal knowledge. However, such knowledge should be acquired—only from a genuine spiritual master, who himself is God-realized. Being his Guru, Shree Krishna instructs Arjun to cut apart all doubts that have arisen in his heart with this sword of knowledge. He asks Arjun to now get up and perform his duty as a warrior."

The ascending process is laborious, imperfect, and time-consuming.

The ascending process is exceedingly time-consuming, and we may not even be able to complete the inquiry in our lifetime. We can also not be sure about the validity of our conclusions. In comparison, the descending process gives us instant access to the deepest secrets of Physics. If our teacher has perfect knowledge of Physics, then it is very straightforward—simply listen to the science from him and digest what he says.

God is definitely incorporeal and formless, but that does not mean that he cannot simultaneously have a form as well. Since God is all-powerful, he has the power to manifest in a form if he wishes.

Thus, the sovereign recipe to cleanse the mind from the defects of lust, anger, greed, envy, and illusion, is to detach it from the world and attach it to the Supreme Lord.

The Kshatriyas are those who have a preponderance of the mode of passion mixed with a smaller amount of the mode of goodness. They are inclined toward administration and management. The Vaishyas are those who possess the mode of passion mixed with some mode of ignorance. Accordingly, they form the business and agricultural class. Then there are the Shudras, who are predominated by the mode of ignorance. They form the working class. This classification was neither meant to be according to birth, nor was it unchangeable.

In this type of yajña (sacrifice), the actions of the senses are suspended, except for the bare maintenance of the body. The mind is completely withdrawn from the senses and made introvertive, by force of will-power.",

In this second type of yajña, the senses are made to behold the glory of the Creator that manifests in every atom of his creation. The senses no longer remain as instruments for material enjoyment; rather they are sublimated to perceive God in everything. In verse 7.8, Shree Krishna says: raso ‘ham apsu kaunteya “Arjun, know me to be the taste in water.” Accordingly, bhakti yogis practice to behold God through all their senses, in everything they see, hear, taste, feel, and smell. This yajña of devotion is simpler than the path of haṭha yog; it is joyous to perform, and involves a smaller risk of downfall from the path. If one is riding a bicycle and presses the brakes to stop the forward motion, he will be in an unstable condition, but if the cyclist simply turns the handle to the left or right, the bicycle will very easily stop its forward motion and still remain stably balanced.",

      "In this chapter, Shree Krishna compares karm sanyās yog (the path of renunciation of actions) with karm-yog (the path of work in devotion). He says: we can choose either of the two paths, as both lead to the same destination. However, he explains that renunciation of actions is rather challenging and can only be performed flawlessly by those whose minds are adequately pure. And purification of the mind can only be achieved by working in devotion. Therefore, karm-yog is a more appropriate path for the majority of humankind.",
      "The karm yogis with a purified intellect perform their worldly duties without any attachment to its fruit. They dedicate all their works and its results to God. Just as a lotus leaf that floats on water does not get wet, the karm yogis also remain unaffected by sin. They are aware that the soul resides within the body that is like a city with nine gates. Therefore, they do not consider themselves to be the doer nor the enjoyer of their actions. Endowed with the vision of equality, they look equally upon a Brahmin, a cow, an elephant, a dog, and a dog-eater. Seated in the Absolute Truth, such truly learned people develop flawless qualities similar to God. The ignorant worldly people do not realize that the pleasures they strive to relish from their sense objects are the very source of their misery. However, the Karm Yogis do not get any joy from such worldly pleasures. Instead, they enjoy the bliss of God who resides inside them.",
      "Lord Shree Krishna then describes karm sanyās yog or the path of renunciation. He says that the karm sanyāsīs control their mind, intellect, and senses by performing several austerities. By shutting out all their thoughts of external pleasures, they become free from fear, desire, and anger. And by including devotion to God in all their austerities, they attain long-lasting peace."

Phalgu vairāgya is where people look upon the world as cumbersome, and renounce it with the desire of getting rid of responsibilities and hardships.  Such phalgu vairāgya is an escapist attitude and is unstable.  The renunciation of such persons is motivated by the desire to run away from difficulties.  When such persons encounter difficulties on the spiritual path, they become detached from there as well, and desire to run back to worldly life.  Yukt vairāgya is where people see the whole world as the energy of God.  They do not see what they possess as belonging to them, and do not wish to enjoy it for themselves.  Instead, they are motivated by the desire to serve God with whatever He has given to them.  Yukt vairāgya is stable and undeterred by difficulties.",

Even animals are subject to these urges, but unlike humans they are not bestowed with the discrimination to restrain them.  However, the human intellect has been bestowed with the power of discrimination.  The word sodhum means “to withstand.”  This verse instructs us to withstand the urges of desire and anger.  Sometimes one restrains the urges of the mind out of embarrassment.  Let us say there is a man sitting at the airport.  A beautiful lady comes and sits by his side.  His mind desires the pleasure of putting his arm around her, but the intellect resists with the thought, “This is improper conduct.  The lady may even slap me for it.”  To avoid the shame of censure, he restrains himself.  Here Shree Krishna is not asking Arjun to restrain the mind out of embarrassment, fear, or apprehension, but through discrimination based on knowledge.  ",

It is advantageous in that there is no diversion of time and energy toward worldly duties, and one can dedicate oneself fully to the practice of spirituality.  There have been many accomplished sanyāsīs in history.  Shree Krishna states that such true karm sanyāsīs also make rapid progress and experience peace everywhere.

      "Shree Krishna continues the comparative evaluation between Karm Yog (the practice of spirituality while performing worldly duties) and Karm Sanyas (the practice of spirituality in a renounced state) in this chapter. He reiterates that Karm Yog is a more practicable path than Karm Sanyas. When work is done with devotion, it purifies the mind and enhances the spiritual realization. The mind then becomes tranquil, and meditation becomes the primary means of elevation. The yogis strive to conquer the mind through meditation because, while a trained mind is the best friend, an untrained mind can be the worst enemy for a spiritual aspirant. He cautions Arjun that by merely engaging in severe austerities, one cannot progress on the spiritual path. Therefore, moderation must be maintained, even in basic necessities like food, sleep, work, recreation, etc.",
      "Shree Krishna then explains yog sādhanā or the spiritual practice for uniting the mind with God. He says, similar to a lamp that does not flicker in a windless place: a sādhak should practice keeping his mind steady in meditation. He agrees that it is difficult to restrain the mind, but it can be controlled by practice and detachment. Therefore, whenever it wanders away, one needs to bring it back and continue to focus upon God. Then the mind gets purified and is established in transcendence or samādhi, which is a joyous state where one experiences infinite divine bliss.",
      "Arjun asks what happens to those spiritual aspirants who begin their journey, but due to an unsteady mind, they are unable to reach their goal. Shree Krishna reassures him that those who strive for God-realization are able to overcome evil. God keeps an account of all our accumulated spiritual merits from past lives and reawakens their wisdom in future births.  In this way, they can continue their journey from where they had left off. And with the help of their accrued merits from previous lives, in their present life, the yogis fast track towards God.",
      "The Lord then concludes this chapter with a declaration that the yogi (who strives to unite with God) is superior to the tapasvī (ascetic), the jñānī (person of learning), and the karmī (ritualistic performer). And highest among all the yogis is the one who engages in bhakti (loving devotion of God)."

It is a form of Maya, and it impedes the path of spirituality.” In the second kind of renunciation, one would say, “Money is also a form of the energy of God. Do not waste it or throw it away; utilize whatever you have in your possession for the service of God.”",

The river Phalgu runs below the surface. From atop, it seems as if there is no water, but if you dig a few feet, you encounter the stream below. Similarly, many persons renounce the world to go and live in monasteries, only to find that in a few years the renunciation has vanished and the mind is again attached to the world. Their detachment was phalgu vairāgya. Finding the world to be troublesome and miserable, they desired to get away from it by taking shelter in monastery. But when they found spiritual life also to be difficult and arduous, they got detached from spirituality as well. Then there are others who establish their loving relationship with God. Motivated by the desire to serve him, they renounce the world to live in a monastery. Their renunciation is yukt vairāgya. They usually continue the journey even if they face difficulties.",

Since it is the mind that has to be united with God, this is only possible if the mind is free from all material desires.

Only one who practices for several hours every day achieves the mastery required to win the Olympics. Practice is essential for spiritual mastery as well. Shree Krishna now explains the process of accomplishing spiritual mastery by recommending the daily practice of meditation. The first point he mentions is the need for a secluded place. All day long, we are usually surrounded by a worldly environment; these material activities, people, and conversations, all tend to make the mind more worldly. In order to elevate the mind toward God, we need to dedicate some time on a daily basis for secluded sādhanā.",

It can now challenge the water, “I will sit on your head and float; you can do nothing to me because I have become butter now.” Our mind is like the milk and the world is like water. In contact with the world, the mind gets affected by it and becomes worldly. However, an environment of seclusion, which offers minimal contact with the objects of the senses, becomes conducive for elevating the mind and focusing it upon God. Once sufficient attachment for God has been achieved, one can challenge the world, “I will live amidst all the dualities of Maya, but remain untouched by them.”",

In our daily schedule, we can allocate some time for sādhanā, or spiritual practice, where we isolate ourselves in a room that is free from worldly disturbances. Shutting ourselves out from the world, we should do sādhanā to purify the mind and solidify its focus upon God. If we practice in this manner for one to two hours every day, we will reap its benefits all through the day even while engaged in worldly activities. In this manner we will be able to retain the elevated state of consciousness that was gathered during the daily sādhanā in isolation from the world.",

But for neophytes, clean surroundings help in keeping the mind clean as well. A mat of kuśh grass provides temperature insulation from the ground, akin to the yoga mats of today. The deer skin atop it deters poisonous pests like snakes and scorpions from approaching while one is absorbed in meditation. If the āsan is too high, there is the risk of falling off; if the āsan is too low, there is danger of disturbance from insects on the ground. Some instructions regarding external seating given in this verse may be somewhat anachronous to modern times, in which case the spirit of the instruction is to be absorbed in the thought of God, while the instructions for the internal practice remain the same.",

This creates the possibility for the mind to become languid when focused on God. Hence, you do not find people dozing off half-way through their meal, but you do see people falling asleep during meditation and the chanting of God’s names.

The secret of health lies in preservation of this vital force. He who wastes this vital and precious energy cannot have physical, mental, moral, and spiritual development.” According to Ayurveda, forty drops of blood go into making one drop of semen. Those who waste their semen develop unsteady and agitated prāṇ. They lose their physical and mental energy, and weaken their memory, mind, and intellect. The practice of celibacy leads to a boost of bodily energy, clarity of intellect, gigantic will power, retentive memory, and a keen spiritual intellect.

However, after a few days of practicing in this manner, the lack of nourishment made him weak and dizzy, and he found it impossible to steady his mind in meditation. At that time, some village women happened to be passing by. They were carrying water pots on their heads that they had filled from the river nearby, and were singing a song. The words of the song were: “Tighten the strings of the tānpurā (a stringed Indian musical instrument, resembling a guitar). But do not tighten them so much that the strings break.” Their words entered the ears of Gautam Buddha, and he exclaimed, “These illiterate village women are singing such words of wisdom. They contain a message for us humans. We too should tighten our bodies (practice austerities), but not to the extent that the body is destroyed.”",

The power of discrimination comes with the conviction of the intellect about the impermanence of the world and the eternality of one’s relationship with God. Thus utilizing the intellect, one must gradually cease sensual indulgence. This is called pratyāhār, or control of the mind and senses from running toward the objects of the senses.

Instead, if we see the Supreme Lord seated in that person, we will think, “God is testing me through this person. He wants me to increase the virtue of tolerance, and that is why he is inspiring this person to behave badly with me. But I will not permit the incident to disturb me.” Thinking in this way, we will be able to prevent the mind from becoming a victim of negative sentiments.",

This proficiency comes solely through practice. Similarly, the obstinate and turbulent mind has to be made to rest on the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord through abhyās.

It comes from being a part of God, who is all-perfect, and hence the soul too wishes to be perfect and successful like its source—God. Success can be attained in two realms—material and spiritual. Those who consider the world to be a source of happiness strive for material advancement. And those who consider spiritual wealth to be the real treasure worthy of possessing, strive for it by rejecting material endeavors. However, if such spiritualists fail in their attempt, they are apparently left with neither spiritual nor material assets. Thinking in this manner, Arjun asks whether their position is like that of a broken cloud. A cloud, which breaks away from the group of clouds, becomes worthless. It neither offers sufficient shade, nor does it increase its weight and become rain-bearing. It merely blows in the wind and perishes like a non-entity in the sky.

One falls from Yog because of the desire for bhog. So God, like an indulgent father, gives that fallen yogi a chance to engage in bhog in the next life and realize that it is an exercise in futility, which does not satiate the yearning of the soul for permanent bliss.

      "This chapter begins with Shree Krishna describing the material and spiritual dimensions of God’s energies. He explains that similar to beads strung on a single thread, all these energies have originated from Him and rest in Him. The entire creation begins and dissolves into Him. Although it is very difficult to overcome His material energy Maya, those who surrender to Him can easily cross over it by His grace.",
      "He then describes the four kinds of people who engage in His devotion and the other four who do not surrender to Him. He says that those devotees who worship Him in knowledge with their mind and intellect merged in Him, are dearest to Him. Yet, some are deluded by material desires and surrender to the celestial gods, who bestow upon them temporary material prosperity. However, these celestial gods also get their powers from the Supreme Lord. Therefore, the worthiest object of devotion is the Almighty God Himself.",
      "Shree Krishna further confirms that He is the ultimate truth and the highest authority. He possesses several divine attributes such as omnipotence, omnipresence, and omniscience. However, His divine Yogmaya power hides His imperishable nature and eternal divine form. Those devotees who surrender to Him and take His shelter receive the divine knowledge of the Supreme God, the self, and the entire field of the karmic actions."

Hearing all the commotion, your friend comes and finds you at the gate troubled by his dog. He sternly says to the dog, “No, Tommy, that is a friend, we need to let him in, come and sit down here.” Hearing his master’s command, the dog silently goes and sits near him.

Thus, decide to take shelter in God. Similarly, those who find that the worldly supports fail to protect them; turn to God for protection. An apt example in the Mahabharata was Draupadi’s surrender to Shree Krishna when Duryodhan and Dushasan tried to dishonor her in the courtroom of Hastinapur. Initially, she expected her husbands would protect her, but they did not. She pleaded the elders in the courtroom, Bheeshma, Vidur, Dhritarashtra, Dronacharya, Kripacharya, etc. However, everyone remained speechless. When cruel Dushasan tried to disrobe her, she clenched her sari with her teeth and tried to protect her honor with her own strength. But her teeth could not hold on to the sari for long; they gave in to Dushasan’s strength. She was helpless and finally called out to Shree Krishna for help. It was at this point that she surrendered completely to God and was not relying on anyone or her own strength for protection. Shree Krishna reciprocated immediately and intervened. Now, how much ever Dushasan pulled, Draupadi’s sari kept extending, and very soon, there was a huge pile of cloth in the middle of the courtroom. Dushasan was unable to disrobe Draupadi; exhausted, he gave up. Such was the power of God’s protection, but it came only when Draupadi surrendered completely.",

He checks it and says, “This is pure gold and worth at least $500”. The man feels thrilled to have found something precious and wears it every day. A few days pass by, and his uncle visits him, who is a jeweller. The uncle looks at the ring and says, “The stone on your gold ring is a precious diamond. Where did you get this? It costs more than $50,000.” On hearing this, the man is overwhelmed and could not believe what his uncle just said. His uncle understood this and said, “It seems, you don’t believe me, I am willing to pay you $40,000 for it.” Now, the man feels elated as if he has won a lottery.

Similarly, these celestial gods also occupy different positions in the working of God’s creation. They derive their powers from God; they are not independent of Him. They can bestow on their devotees only material things that are under their control. But cannot liberate anyone from the bondage of Maya or the cycle of birth and death because; they themselves are not liberated from this cycle. God alone has the power to do so. The celestial gods are also souls like us. However, they have attained these positions in the celestial abodes as a result of their pious deeds from previous lives. Once their account of pious deeds depletes, they have to return to earth. Hence, even the celestial gods are perishable; God alone is eternal.",

      "In this chapter, Shree Krishna briefly describes several significant concepts and terms that the Upanishads expound in detail. He also explains what decides the destination of the soul after death. He says that if we remember God at the time of death, we can definitely attain Him. Therefore, alongside doing our daily works, we must practice to always think of God. We can do this by thinking of His Qualities, Attributes, Virtues, etc. A persistent yogic meditation upon God by chanting His Names is also a good practice. Through exclusive devotion, when our mind is perfectly absorbed in Him, we will elevate from the material dimension to the spiritual realm.",
      "Shree Krishna then talks about the various abodes in the material realm and the cycle of creation. He further explains how the multitudes of beings’ manifest on these abodes, and at the time of dissolution, everything absorbs back into Him. However, the divine Abode of God is untouched by this cycle of creation and dissolution. Those who progress on the path of light finally reach the divine abode and never return to the material world. Whereas those fallen souls who tread the path of darkness endlessly keep transmigrating in the cycle of birth, old age, sickness, and death."

One day, he saw a pregnant deer jump into the water on hearing a tiger roar.  Out of fear, the pregnant deer delivered a baby deer that began floating on the water.  Bharat felt pity on the baby deer and rescued it.  He took it to his hut and began bringing it up.  With great affection, he would watch its frolicking movements.  He would gather grass to feed it, and would hug it to keep it warm.  Slowly, his mind came away from God and became absorbed in the deer.  The absorption became so deep that, practically all day long, his thoughts would wander toward the deer.  When he was about to die, he called out to the deer in fond remembrance, concerned about what would happen to him.  Consequently, in his next life, Maharaj Bharat became a deer.  However, because he had performed spiritual sādhanā, he was aware of the mistake in his previous life, and so even as a deer, he would reside near the āśhrams of saintly persons in the forest.  Finally, when he gave up the deer body, he was again given a human birth.  This time, he became the great sage Jadabharat, and attained God-realization by completing his sādhanā.",

Death is such a painful experience, that the mind naturally gravitates to the thoughts that constitute one’s inner nature.  For the mind to think of God requires one’s inner nature to be united with Him.  The inner nature is the consciousness that abides within one’s mind and intellect.  Only if we contemplate something continuously does it manifest as a part of our inner nature.  So to develop a God-consciousness inner nature, the Lord must be remembered, recollected, and contemplated upon at every moment of our life.  This is what Shree Krishna states in the next verse.",

Shree Krishna says, “Keep your mind attached to Me, and do your worldly duty with your body.”  This applies to people in all walks of life—doctors, engineers, advocates, housewives, students, etc.  In Arjun’s specific case, he is a warrior and his duty is to fight.  So he is being instructed to fulfill his duty, while keeping his mind in God.  Some people neglect their worldly duties on the plea that they have taken to spiritual life.  Others excuse themselves from spiritual practice on the pretext of worldly engagements.  People believe that spiritual and material pursuits are irreconcilable.  But God’s message is to sanctify one’s entire life.",

But since the mind is attached to God, these works will not bind one in the law of karma.  Only those works result in karmic reactions which are performed with attachment.  When that attachment does not exist, even worldly law does not hold one culpable.  For example, let us say that one man killed another and is brought to court.  The judge asks him, “Did you kill that man?”  The man replies, “Yes, your honor, there is no need for any witness.  I confess that I killed him.”  “Then you should be punished!”  “No, your honor, you cannot punish me.”  “Why?”  “I had no intention to kill.  I was driving the car on the proper side of the road, within speed limits, with my eyes focused ahead.  My brakes, steering, everything was perfect.  That man suddenly ran in front of my car.  What could I do?”  If his attorney can establish that the intention to kill did not exist, the judge will let him off without even the slightest punishment.    ",

The same principle holds for the law of karma as well.  That is why, during the Mahabharat war, following Shree Krishna’s instructions, Arjun did his duty on the battlefield.  By the end of the war, Shree Krishna noted that Arjun did not accrue any bad karma.  He would have been entangled in karma if he had been fighting the battle with attachment, for worldly gain or fame.  However, his mind was attached to Shree Krishna, and so what he was doing was multiplication in zeros, performing his duty in this world without selfish attachment.

Often people claim to be karm yogis because they say they do both—karm and yog.  For the major part of the day, they do karm, and for a few minutes they do yog (meditation on God).  But this is not the definition of karm-yog that Shree Krishna has given.

One of the beauties of the Bhagavad Gita is that it embraces a variety of sādhanās, thereby bringing people of diverse upbringing, backgrounds, and personalities in its embrace.  When western scholars attempt to read the Hindu scriptures without the help of a Guru, they often become confused by the variety of paths, instructions, and philosophical viewpoints in its various scriptures.  However, this variety is actually a blessing.  Because of the sanskārs (tendencies) of endless lifetimes, we all have different natures and preferences.  When four people go to buy clothes for themselves, they end up choosing different colors, styles, and fashions.  If the shop kept clothes of only one color and style, it would be unable to cater to the variety inherent in human nature.  Similarly, on the spiritual path too, people have performed various sādhanās in past lifetimes.  The Vedic scriptures embrace that variety, while simultaneously stressing bhakti (devotion to God) as the common thread that ties them all together.",

It is also called the bīja mantra, because it is often attached to the beginning of the Vedic mantras, just as hrīṁ, klīṁ, etc.  The vibrations of Om consist of three letters: A…U…M.  In the proper chanting of Om, one begins by making the sound “A” from the belly, with an open throat and mouth.  This is merged into the chanting of the sound “U” that is created from the middle of the mouth.  The sequence ends with chanting “M” with the mouth closed.

For example, if we put our hand in the fire, two things happen—the skin starts getting burnt, and the neurons create a sensation of pain in the brain.  The burning of the skin is a bad thing, but the sensation of pain is a good thing.  If we did not experience the pain, we would not extract our hand from the fire, and it would suffer extensive damage.  The pain is thus an indication that something is wrong, which needs to be corrected.

Until then, the entire Western world believed that the earth was the center of the universe.

Occasionally, when no soul is eligible to perform the duties of Brahma at the time of the creation of the world, God Himself becomes Brahma.",

The six months of the southern solstice, the dark fortnight of the moon, the night, all these have the commonality of darkness.   Those, whose consciousness is established in God and detached from sensual pursuits, depart by the path of light (discrimination and knowledge).  Being situated in God-consciousness, they attain the Supreme Abode of God, and are released from the wheel of samsara.  But those, whose consciousness is attached to the world, depart by the path of darkness (ignorance).  Being entangled in the bodily concept of life and the illusion of separation from God, they continue rotating in the cycle of life and death.  If they had performed Vedic ritualistic activities, they are temporarily promoted to the celestial abodes, and then have to return to the earth planet.  In this way, all human beings have to take one of the two paths after death.  It now depends upon them, according to their karmas, whether they pass along the bright path or the dark path.",

    "description": [
      "In the two previous chapters, the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna declared that among all, bhakti is the highest, yet the simplest path of attaining Yog, or union with the Supreme. In this chapter, He reveals His supreme glories that inspire reverence, devotion, and awe. Although Shree Krishna stands in front of Arjun in His personal form, this form should not be mistaken to possess human personality. At the beginning of creation, the Supreme Lord creates innumerable life-forms with His material energy. And at dissolution, He absorbs them back into Himself, and in the next cycle of creation, He manifests them again. All living beings’ dwell within Him, like the mighty winds that blow everywhere, yet always stay within the sky. However, He remains ever aloof and detached from all these activities as a neutral observer by His divine Yogmaya power.",
      "To resolve the apparent confusion of the Hindu pantheon, Shree Krishna explains that there is only one God, who is the sole object of worship. For all living beings, He is the true friend, the support, refuge, and the final goal. Therefore, those souls who engage in exclusive devotion towards the Supreme Lord go to His abode and remain there. Those influenced by the ritualistic ceremonies described in the Vedas also attain the celestial abodes. However, when their merits are exhausted, they must return to earth. Saying this, Shree Krishna exalts the superiority of pure bhakti solely directed toward Him. Such a devotee lives in complete union with God’s will, doing everything for Him and offering everything to Him. Such pure devotion helps devotees attain the mystic union with God and releases them from the bondage of Karmas.",
      "Shree Krishna asserts that He is impartial towards all creatures; He neither favors nor rejects anyone. Even if despicable sinners come to His shelter, He accepts them willingly and very quickly makes them pure and virtuous. Shree Krishna then says that He is seated within His devotees and will not let them perish. He preserves what they possess and provides them what they lack. Hence, we should dedicate our mind and body to Him, worship Him, always think of Him, and make Him our supreme goal."

Lord Krishna clarifies this because God is going to glorify Himself profusely here.  Anasūyave also has the sense of “one who does not scorn.”  Those listeners who deride Shree Krishna because they believe He is boasting will not benefit from hearing such a message.  Rather, they will incur harm, by thinking, “Look at this egotistic person.  He is praising His own Self.”  ",

Envious people cannot grasp the simple fact that God has no need for anything, and therefore everything He does is for the welfare of the souls.  He only praises Himself to enhance devotion in the souls, and not because He has the material defect of conceit as we do.  When Jesus of Nazareth said, “I am the path and the way,” he was saying it motivated by compassion for the souls listening to him, and not out of vanity.  As a true Guru, he was telling his disciples that the path to God is through the Guru.  But the envious-minded do not understand the compassion behind these statements and attribute them to self-conceit.  Since Arjun is magnanimous and free from the defect of envy, he is eminently qualified for the profound knowledge that Shree Krishna is going to reveal in this chapter. ",

It inspires sacrifice of the self at the altar of divine love for the Supreme Lord.  Bhakti also purifies the devotee by destroying pāp, bīja, and avidyā.  Pāp is the stockpile of past sins of endless lifetimes of the individual soul.  Bhakti burns them up as a fire burns up a bundle of straw.  Bīja refers to impurities of the heart, which are the seeds of sinful activities.  If the seeds exist, then destroying the results of past sins will not suffice, for the propensity to sin will remain in the heart and one will sin again.  Bhakti purifies the heart and destroys the seeds of sin, which are lust, anger, and greed.  However, even the destruction of the seeds is not enough.  The reason why the heart becomes impure is that there is avidyā (ignorance), because of which we identify with the body.  Because of this misidentification, we think of the body as the self, and hence create bodily desires thinking they will give happiness to the self.  Fulfillment of such material desires further leads to lust, anger, greed, and all the other impurities of the heart.  As long as the ignorance remains, even if the heart is cleansed, it will again become impure.  Devotion ultimately results in realized knowledge of the soul and God, which in turn destroys the ignorance of material existence.  The benefits of bhakti are described in the Bhakti Rasāmṛit Sindhu as follows:  kleśhas tu pāpaṁ tadbījam avidyā cheti te tridhā  (1.1.18)  “Bhakti destroys the three poisons—pāp (sins), bīja (the seed of sins), avidyā (the ignorance in the heart).”  Only when the three are completely destroyed, does the heart become truly and permanently pure.

If the judge adopted the philosophy of believing only what he or she had directly experienced, then the entire legal system would fail.  A President administers a country on the basis of reports from all over the country.  It is impossible for him to visit and see all the villages and cities within his domain.  Now, if he was not willing to believe these reports, on the grounds that he had no direct perception of what was happening, how would he be able to administer the whole country?

Do you believe that this milk, freshly taken out from the cow, contains butter?”  The king said he had full faith that it did.  The sadhu said, “You cannot see the butter in the milk.  Then why do you believe it is there?”  The king replied, “We cannot see it at present because the butter is pervading the milk, but there is a process for seeing it.  If we convert the milk into yogurt, and then churn the yogurt, the butter will become visible.”  The sadhu said, “Like the butter in the milk, God is everywhere.  If we cannot immediately perceive Him, we should not jump to the conclusion that there is no God.  There is a process for perceiving Him; if we are willing to have faith and follow the process, we will then get direct perception of God and become God-realized.”",

Then, the souls that were lying in a state of suspended animation with only causal bodies are again placed in the world.  In accordance with their causal bodies, they again receive subtle and gross bodies, and the various life forms are created in the universe.  These life forms vary in nature amongst the different planes of existence.  In some planetary systems, fire is the dominant element in the body, just as in the earth plane, the dominant bodily elements are earth and water.

The main idea to keep in mind is that although the process of creation goes on by His will and inspiration of God, He remains unaffected by the work of the material energy.  He remains ever-blissful and undisturbed in His personality, by virtue of His hlāndinī śhakti (bliss-giving power).

However, in bodily consciousness, we look upon the relatives of the body as our father, mother, beloved, child, and friend.  We become attached to them and repeatedly bring them to our mind, thereby getting further bound in the material illusion.  But none of these worldly relatives can give us the perfect love that our soul yearns for.  This is for two reasons.  Firstly, these relationships are temporary, and separation is unavoidable when either they or we depart from the world.  Secondly, even as long as they are alive, the attachment is based on selfishness and so it fluctuates in direct proportion to the extent by which self-interest is satisfied.  Thus, the range and intensity of worldly love varies from moment to moment, throughout the day.  “My wife is very nice….she is not so nice…she is ok….she is terrible,” this is the extent of fluctuation of love in the drama of the world.  On the other hand, God is such a relative who has accompanied us lifetime after lifetime.  From birth to birth, in every life-form that we went, God accompanied us and remained seated in our heart.  He is thus our eternal relative.  In addition, He has no self-interest from us; He is perfect and complete in Himself.  He loves us selflessly, for He only desires our eternal welfare.  Thus, God alone is our perfect relative, who is both eternal and selfless.",

Two neighboring waves in the ocean flow together for some time, and play mirthfully with each other, creating the impression that they have a very deep relationship between them.  However, after travelling some distance, one subsides into the ocean, and shortly after, the other does the same.  Did they have any relationship between themselves?  No, they were both born from the ocean and their relationship was with the ocean itself.  Similarly, God is like the ocean and we are like waves who have emanated from Him.  We create attachments amongst our bodily relations, only to leave everyone upon death, and journey alone into another birth.

The baby simply cries whenever it needs anything; the mother cleans it, feeds it, bathes it, etc.  But when the baby becomes a five-year old child, it begins doing some actions for itself.  To that extent the mother reduces her responsibilities.  And when the same child becomes a youth and assumes all responsibilities, the mother relinquishes her responsibilities further.  Now if the father comes home and asks, “Where is our son?” the mother replies, “He has not returned home after school.  He must have gone for a movie with his friends.”  Her attitude is now more neutral toward him.  But when the same boy was a five-year old, and had gotten delayed by ten minutes in returning home from school, both the mother and father would begin worrying, “What has happened?  He is a small child.  Let’s hope he has not met with an accident.  Let us phone the school and find out.” ",

He merely notes our karmas and gives the result.  When we surrender partially to Him and partially depend upon material crutches, God also partially bestows His grace upon us.

However, Shree Krishna rejected his hospitality and instead went to the humble hut of Vidurani, who had been longing deeply for the opportunity to serve her beloved Lord.  Vidurani was overjoyed on receiving the Supreme Lord at her home.  All she had to offer was bananas, but her intellect so benumbed with loving sentiments that she did not even realize she was dropping the fruit and putting the banana peels in His mouth.  Nevertheless, seeing her devotion, Shree Krishna blissfully ate the peels, as if they were the most delicious food in the world.",

There is no partiality on the part of the rain, since it is equitable in bestowing its grace upon the land.  The raindrops cannot be held responsible for this variation in results, which are a consequence of the nature of the recipient.  Similarly, God states here that He is equally disposed toward all living beings, and yet, those who do not love Him are bereft of the benefits of His grace because their hearts are unsuitable vessels for receiving it.

      "The previous chapter revealed the science of bhakti or loving devotion of God. In this chapter, Shree Krishna desires to increase Arjun’s bhakti by describing His infinite glories and opulence. The verses are not only pleasing to read, but also enchanting to hear. He helps Arjun to meditate on God by reflecting upon His magnificence.",
      "He reveals that He is the source of all that exists. From His mind, the seven great sages, the four great saints, and the fourteen Manus were born. All the people of this world then descended from them. The various exceptional qualities in humans also arise from Him. Those devotees who know this engage in His devotion with great faith. They derive immense satisfaction by conversing about His glories and also help enlightening others about them. God dwells in the hearts of such devotees whose mind is always united in Him. He then bestows upon them His divine knowledge, through which they can attain God-realization.",
      "Arjun is now fully convinced that Shree Krishna is the Supreme Divine Personality and requests Him to describe further His divine glories, which are like divine nectar. Then Lord Shree Krishna reveals that everything that exists is a manifestation of His energies. He is the beginning, middle, and end of all; the infinite reservoir of knowledge, power, beauty, and glory. All beings and things get their splendor from Him; He is the powerhouse of magnificence. Whatever catches our imagination and infuses us with bliss is nothing but a tiny spark of His opulence.",
      "The rest of the chapter describes the personalities, objects, and activities that best display His magnificence. Shree Krishna finally says that the magnitude of His glory cannot be described in words, as within a fraction of His being, He upholds infinite universes. Since God is the source of all the splendor and glory, we must make Him the object of our devotion."

Your friend says, “This is a śhāligrām, and a saintly personality has gifted it to me.” A śhāligrām is a special kind of fossil stone worshipped as a representation of Lord Vishnu. If you are aware of the significance of śhāligrāms, when you receive this knowledge that the stone is a śhāligrām, your appreciation for it will increase. Let us say your friend further adds, “Do you know it used to be worshipped five hundred years ago by the great saint, Swami Ramananda?” The moment you hear this piece of knowledge, your respect for the stone will increase further. Each time, it is the knowledge that is boosting your reverence for the stone. Similarly, proper knowledge of God enhances devotion toward him.

At present, our senses, mind, and intellect are all material, while God is divine. Hence, we are unable to see him, hear him, know him, or be united with him. When God bestows his grace, he confers his divine Yogmaya energy upon the soul. It is also called śhuddha sattva (divine mode of goodness), which is distinct from the sattva guṇa (mode of goodness) of Maya. When we receive that śhuddha sattva energy, our sense, mind, and intellect become divine. To put it simply, by his grace, God bestows his divine senses, divine mind, and divine intellect to the soul. Equipped with these divine instruments, the soul is able to see God, hear God, know God, and be united with God.

When great authorities testify knowledge, its credibility gets established. The great saints are the authorities for spiritual knowledge. Thus, Arjun quotes the saints, such as Narad, Asit, Deval, and Vyas, who have proclaimed Shree Krishna as the Supreme Divine Personality and the cause of all causes. In the Bheeshma Parva of the Mahabharat, there is a poem in which many sages eulogize Shree Krishna. Sage Narad says: “Shree Krishna is the creator of all the worlds and the knower of all feelings. He is the Lord of the celestial gods, who administer the universe.” (Verse 68.2) Sage Markandeya states: “Lord Krishna is the goal of all religious sacrifices and the essence of austerities. He is the present, past, and future of everything.” (Verse 68.3) Sage Bhrigu says: “He is the God of gods and the first original form of Lord Vishnu.” (Verse 68.4) Sage Ved Vyas states: “O Lord Krishna, You are the Lord of the Vasus. You have conferred power on Indra and the other celestial gods.” (Verse 68.5) Sage Angira says: “Lord Krishna is the creator of all beings. All the three worlds exist in his stomach. He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” (Verse 68.6) Elsewhere in the Mahabharat, Sage Asit and Deval declare: “Shree Krishna is the creator of Brahma, who is the creator of the three worlds.” (Mahabharat Vana Parva 12.50) Quoting these great authorities, Arjun says that now Shree Krishna is himself reconfirming their statements by declaring that he is the supreme cause of all creation.",

In desperation, Indra approached Lord Shiv for help, who took him to Lord Vishnu. Vishnu revealed to Indra that the only weapon that could kill Vritrasura was a thunderbolt made from the bones of the sage Dadhichi. Indra then beseeched Dadhichi to make the ultimate sacrifice of laying down his life so that his bones could be used for making the thunderbolt. Dadhichi accepted the request, but desired to first go on a pilgrimage to all the holy rivers. Indra then brought together all the waters of the holy rivers to Naimisharanya, thereby allowing the sage to have his wish fulfilled without further loss of time. Dadhichi then gave up his body by the practice of yogic techniques. The thunderbolt made from his bones was then used to defeat the demon Vritrasura, allowing Indra to regain his place as the king of the celestial abodes. Shree Krishna deliberately refers to this thunderbolt here as the representation of the glory of God, preferring it above the mace and disc that are always held in the hands of Lord Vishnu.",

This sexual urge has its origin in God, and should not be mis-utilized for sensual enjoyment, but rather be used solely for the purpose of begetting worthy progeny.

Along with Mīmānsā, Nyāya, Dharma Śhāstra, and the Puranas, these comprise the fourteen chief vidyās.” Practice of these vidyās cultivates the intellect, deepens the knowledge, and increases awareness of the path of dharma. Additionally, the science of spirituality liberates human beings from material bondage and gives them immortality. Thus, it is superior to the previously mentioned vidyās. This is mentioned in the Śhrīmad Bhāgavatam as well: sā vidyā tanmatiryayā (Verse 4.29.49)[v30] “The best knowledge is that by which the intellect becomes attached to the lotus feet of God.”",

There are primarily six kinds of samāsa: 1) dwandva, 2) bahubṛihi, 3) karm dhāray, 4) tatpuruṣh, 5) dwigu, 6) avyayī bhāv. Amongst these, dwandva is the best because both words remain prominent in it, while in the others, either one word becomes more prominent, or both words combine together to give the meaning of a third word.

      "In the previous chapter, Shree Krishna described his divine vibhūtis (opulences) to nourish and increase Arjun’s devotion. At the end, he faintly alluded to his universal cosmic form, by saying that all things beautiful, glorious, and powerful manifest from just a spark of his splendor. In this chapter, Arjun requests to see Shree Krishna’s viśhwarūp, or the infinite cosmic form of God that encompasses all the universes. Shree Krishna obliges by granting him divine vision. Arjun then sees the totality of creation in the body of the God of gods. He observes unlimited faces, eyes, arms, and stomachs in the wonderful and infinite form of the Lord. The form has no beginning or end, and extends infinitely in every direction. The splendor of that form is more than a thousand suns blazing forth together in the sky. The vision makes Arjun’s hair stand on end. He sees the three worlds trembling in fear of God’s laws. He witnesses the celestial gods taking shelter of him and the great sages extolling him with profuse hymns and prayers. He observers all the sons of Dhritarasthra along with their allied kings rushing headlong into the mouth of that fearsome form, as moths rushing with great speed into the fire to perish. Arjun then confesses that on beholding the universal form his heart is trembling with fear and he has lost his peace of mind. Terrified, he wishes to know the identity of this awesome God, who bears no resemblance now to the Krishna he had known as his teacher and friend. Shree Krishna responds by saying that in the form of time he is the destroyer of the three worlds. He declares that the great Kaurava warriors have already been killed by him, so being assured of victory, Arjun should get up and fight.",
      "In response, Arjun praises him as the Lord who possesses infinite valor and power, and offers him repeated salutations. He asks for forgiveness if during their long friendship he has ever done anything to offend the Lord through mistaking him for a mere human being. He implores for grace and requests to see once again the pleasing form of God. Shree Krishna grants his desire and first returns to his four-armed form, and then to his gentle and loving two-armed form. He tells Arjun how difficult it is to have a vision of God in the manner that Arjun is seeing him. His personal form cannot be seen by the study of the Vedas, nor by penance, charity, or fire sacrifices. By unalloyed devotion alone can one know him as he is, standing before Arjun, and enter into union with him."

However, when we tiny souls possess a personality, then why should we deny a personality to the Supreme Lord? Not only can he have a personality, but he also has the best personality, and therefore he is the Supreme Divine Personality. The difference between our personality and God’s personality is that he is not only a perfect person; he also has his impersonal all-pervading aspect, which is devoid of attributes and form.",

When Oppenheimer, who was a part of the first atom bomb project, witnessed the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, he quoted this verse of Shree Krishna in the following manner: “Time…I am the destroyer of all the worlds.” Time counts and controls the lifespan of all beings. It will determine when the great personalities like Bheeshma, Dronacharya, and Karn will meet their end. It will destroy the enemy army arrayed on the battlefield even without Arjun’s participating in the fight, because the Lord wants it to happen as a part of his grand scheme for the world.

He is everything that is manifest in creation because it is all his energy. He is also everything that remains unmanifest because it is his latent energy.

While interacting with Shree Krishna—playing, eating, jesting, talking, and resting—he did not show the respect that is appropriate toward the Supreme Almighty. However, no one minds transgressions when they are made because of a high level of intimacy shared with the other person. No government officer has the privilege to joke with the President of a country. Yet, the President’s personal friend, teases him, jests with him, and even scolds him. The President does not mind, rather he values that jest of an intimate friend more than all the respect he receives from his subordinate officers. Thousands of people salute an army general, but they are not as dear to his heart as his wife, who sits intimately by his side. Similarly, Arjun’s intimate dealings with Shree Krishna were not transgressions; they were gestures of the depth of his loving devotion in the sentiment of being a friend. Yet, a devotee is by nature humble, and so, out of humility, he feels that he may have committed transgressions, and hence he is asking for forgiveness.",

However, Arjun was a sakhā (friend) of Shree Krishna, and devotion dominated by the sentiment of awe and reverence would never satisfy him. He had played with Shree Krishna, eaten with him, confided his private secrets to him, and shared loving personal moments with him. Such blissful devotion of sakhya bhāv (devotion where God is seen as a personal friend) is infinitely sweeter than aiśhwarya bhakti (devotion where God is revered as the distant and almighty Lord).

They had been habituated to seeing the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna as their soul-beloved, and this form of his as Lord Vishnu held no attraction for them.

      "This small chapter stresses on the super-excellence of the path of loving devotion over all other types of spiritual practices.  It begins with Arjun asking Shree Krishna whom He considers more perfect in Yog—those who are devoted to the personal form of God or those who worship the formless Brahman.  Shree Krishna responds by declaring that both paths lead to God-realization.  However, He regards the devotees of His personal form as the best yogis.  He explains that meditation on the impersonal unmanifest aspect of God is full of tribulations and is exceedingly difficult for embodied beings.  But devotees of the personal form, with their consciousness merged in Him and all their actions dedicated to Him, are swiftly delivered from the cycle of life and death.  Shree Krishna thus asks Arjun to surrender his intellect to Him, and fix his mind in exclusive loving devotion on Him alone. ",
      "However, such love is often not forthcoming in the struggling soul.  So Shree Krishna gives other options, and says that if Arjun cannot immediately reach the stage of complete absorption of the mind in God, he should strive to reach that stage of perfection by constant practice.  Devotion is not a mysterious gift and can be cultivated by regular effort.  If Arjun cannot do even this much, he should still not admit defeat; rather he should work in devotion for the pleasure of Shree Krishna.  If this is also not possible, then he should merely renounce the fruits of his works and be situated in the self.  He then explains that higher than mechanical practice is the cultivation of knowledge; higher than the cultivation of knowledge is meditation; and higher than meditation is the renunciation of fruits of actions, which immediately leads to great peace.  The remaining verses of the chapter describe the wonderful qualities of God’s loving devotees who are very dear to Him."

The first and foremost reason for this is that we humans possess a form ourselves and we have been habituated to interacting with forms in endless lifetimes.  Thus, while striving to love God as well, if our mind has a wonderful enchanting form to meditate upon, it can easily focus upon it and increase its attachment to the Lord.  However, in the case of the formless, the intellect cannot conceive of it, and the mind and senses have no tangible object to relate to.  So both the endeavors of meditating on God and increasing the mind’s attachment to Him become difficult.",

            "value": "Worship of Brahman is also difficult in comparison to that of Bhagavān for another reason.  The difference in paths can be understood through the markaṭ-kiśhore nyāya (the logic of the baby) monkey, and mārjār-kiśhore nyāya (the logic of the baby kitten).  The baby monkey is responsible for holding onto her mother’s stomach; it is not helped by its mother.  When the mother monkey jumps from one branch to another, the onus of clinging tightly onto the mother is upon the baby, and if it is unable to do so, it falls.  In contrast, a kitten is very small and delicate, but the mother takes the responsibility of transporting it from one place to another, by holding the kitten from behind the neck and lifting it up.  In the analogy, the devotees of the formless can be compared to the baby monkey and the devotees of the personal form can be compared to the baby kitten.  Those who worship the formless Brahman have the onus of progressing on the path by themselves, because Brahman does not bestow grace upon them.  Brahman is not only formless, It is also without attributes.  It has been described as nirguṇa (without qualities), nirviśheṣh (without attributes), and nirākār (without form).  From this, it follows that Brahman does not manifest the quality of grace.  The jñānīs who worship God as nirguṇa, nirviśheṣh, and nirākār, have to rely entirely upon self-effort for progress.  On the other hand, the personal form of God is an ocean of compassion and mercy.  Hence, devotees of the personal form receive the help of divine support in their sādhanā.  On the basis of the protection that God bestows upon His devotees, Shree Krishna stated in verse 9.31: “O son of Kunti, declare it boldly that My devotee never perishes.”  He confirms the same statement in the next two verses.",

The reason is that without the engagement of the mind, mere sensory activity is of no value.  For example, we hear a sermon with our ears, but if the mind wanders off, we will not know what was said.  The words will fall on the ears but they will not register.  This shows that without engaging the mind the work of the senses does not count.  On the other hand, the mind is such an instrument that in it all the senses reside in the subtle form.  Thus, even without the actual sensory activity the mind experiences the perceptions of sight, smell, taste, touch, and sound.  For example, at night when we sleep our senses are inactive.  Yet while dreaming, our mind experiences the objects of all the senses.  This proves that the mind has the capacity to experience all perceptions even without the gross senses.  Therefore, while noting our karmas, God gives importance to the mental works and not the physical works of the senses. ",

The doctor checks our symptoms, looks at our medical reports, makes a diagnosis, and then prescribes the medicines.  We surrender our intellect and take the medicines according to the doctor’s prescription.  Similarly, if we are involved in a legal case, we take the help of a lawyer.

Though we are eternal souls, we think of ourselves to be the perishable body.  Although all the objects of the world are perishable, we think they will always remain with us, and hence, we busily accumulate them day and night.  And though the pursuit of sensual pleasures only results in misery in the long run, we still chase them in the hope that we will find happiness.”  The above three defects of the intellect are called viparyaya, or reversals of knowledge under material illusion.  The gravity of our problem is further aggravated because our intellect is habituated to this kind of defective thinking from innumerable previous lifetimes.  If we run our lives in accordance with the directions of our intellect, we will definitely not make much progress on the divine path.  Thus, if we wish to achieve spiritual success by attaching the mind to God, we must surrender our intellect to Him and follow His directions.  Surrendering the intellect means to think in accordance with the knowledge received from God via the medium of the scriptures and the bonafide Guru.  The characteristics of a surrendered intellect are described in verse 18.66.",

Rather than doing it out of bodily attachment for them, one should develop the consciousness that the family members are all children of God, and one has a responsibility to take care of them for His pleasure.  One has to continue earning one’s living, but again, a modification can be done in the consciousness with which one works.  Rather than thinking that it is for the purpose of earning money for worldly enjoyment, one can think, “I wish to maintain my family and myself with the earnings to enable us all to engage in devotion.  And whatever I can save, I will donate in the service of God.”  Similarly, the bodily processes of eating, sleeping, bathing, etc. cannot be given up.

Those who are not yet convinced about their relationship with God, and have not yet made God-realization the goal of their lives, may find it impossible to work for His pleasure.  Therefore, Shree Krishna now gives the fourth alternative for welfare.  He says, “Arjun keep doing your works as before, but become detached from the fruits of your actions.”  Such detachment will purify our mind from the modes of ignorance (tamas) and passion (rajas), and bring it to the mode of goodness (sattva).  In this way, renouncing the fruits of our efforts will help remove worldliness from our mind and strengthen the intellect.  Then, the purified intellect will more easily be able to comprehend transcendental knowledge, and we will be able to move to the higher levels of sādhanā.",

When they purchase a new house or a new car, they call the Pundit to perform the pūjā (worship) ceremony.  And while the Pundit performs the pūjā, they sit and talk in the other room or sip a cup of tea.  For them, devotion is nothing more than performing the empty ritual.  It is often performed by way of ceremonial habits that have been passed on from parents and elders.  Performing rituals mechanically is not a bad thing, for after all, something is better than nothing.  At least such people are externally engaging in devotion. ",

Knowledge bestows the understanding that the goal of life is God-realization and not material progress.  One who is versed in knowledge goes beyond the empty rituals and develops the desire to purify the mind.  But mere knowledge by itself cannot cleanse the heart.  And thus, Shree Krishna says that higher than the cultivation of knowledge is the process of engaging the mind in meditation.  By practically controlling the mind through meditation, we begin to develop detachment from worldly pleasures.  When the mind develops some measure of the quality of detachment, we can then practice the next step, which is renunciation of the fruits of actions.  As explained in the previous verse, this will help remove worldliness from the mind and strengthen the intellect for the subsequent higher stages.",

At the beginning of the chapter, Arjun had asked Him regarding whom He considered superior—those who are devoted to His personal form through bhakti-yog, or those who worship the formless Brahman through jñāna-yog.  Shree Krishna responded in the second verse that He considers them to be the highest yogis who steadfastly engage in devotion upon His personal form.  He then continued on the topic of bhakti by explaining first the means of performing devotion and then the qualities of His devotees.  He now ends with the affirmation that the supreme path of spirituality is bhakti.  Those who make the Supreme Lord as their goal and cultivate devotion with great faith, imbued with the virtues mentioned in the previous verses, such devotees are exceedingly dear to God.",

    "description": [
      "The Bhagavad Gita consists of eighteen chapters, which are composed of three segments.  The first set of six chapters describes karm-yog.  The second set describes the glories of bhakti, and for the nourishment of bhakti, it also dwells upon the opulences of God.  The third set of six chapters expounds upon tattva jñāna (knowledge scriptural terms and principles).  The present one is the first of the third set of chapters, and it introduces two terms—kṣhetra (the “field”) and kṣhetrajña (the “knower of the field”).  We may think of the field as the body and the knower of the field as the soul that resides within.  But this is a simplification, for the field is actually much more—it includes the mind, intellect, and ego, and all other components of the material energy that comprise our personality.  In this wider sense, the field of the body encompasses all aspects of our personality, except for the soul who is the “knower the field.” ",
      "As a farmer sows seeds in a field and reaps the harvest from it, we sow the field of our body with good or bad thoughts and actions, and reap the consequent destiny.  The Buddha had explained: “All that we are is the result of what we have thought; it is founded on our thoughts; and it is made of our thoughts.”  Therefore, as we think, that is what we become.  The great American thinker, Ralph Waldo Emerson, said: “The ancestor of every action is thought.”  Thus, we must learn the art of cultivating the field of our body with appropriate thoughts and actions.  This requires knowledge of the distinction between the field and the knower of the field.  In the present chapter, Shree Krishna goes into a detailed analysis of this distinction.  He enumerates the elements of material nature that compose the field of the body.  He describes the modifications that arise in the field, in the form of emotions, sentiments, and feelings.  He also mentions the virtues and qualities that purify the field and illumine it with the light of knowledge.  Such knowledge helps us gain realization of the soul, who is the knower of the field.  The chapter then describes God, who is the supreme knower of the fields of all the living beings.  That Supreme Lord holds contradictory attributes, i.e. He possesses opposite qualities at the same time.  So, He is all-pervading in creation and yet seated in the hearts of all living beings.  He is thus the Supreme Soul of all living beings. ",
      "Having described the soul, the Supreme Soul, and material nature, Shree Krishna then explains which of these is responsible for actions by living beings, and also which is responsible for cause and effect in the world at large.  Those, who can perceive these distinctions and properly pinpoint the causes of action, are the ones who actually see; and they are the ones who are situated in knowledge.  They observe the Supreme Soul present in all living beings, and so they do not degrade themselves by their mind.  They can see the variety of living beings situated in the same material nature.  And when they see the common spiritual substratum pervading all existence, they attain the realization of Brahman."

Jagadguru Shankaracharya’s commentary on the Vedānt Darśhan is called Śhārīrak Bhāṣhya, which lays the foundation for the advait-vād tradition of philosophy.  Many of his followers, such as Vachaspati and Padmapada have elaborated upon his commentary.  Jagadguru Nimbarkarcharya wrote the Vedānt Pārijāta Saurabh, which explains the dwait-advait-vād school of thought.  Jagadguru Ramanujacharya’s commentary is called Śhrī Bhāṣhya, which lays the basis for the viśhiṣhṭ-advait-vād system of philosophy.  Jagadguru Madhvacharya’s commentary is called Brahma Sūtra Bhāṣhyam, which is the foundation for the dwait-vād school of thought.  Mahaprabhu Vallabhacharya wrote Aṇu Bhāṣhya, in which he established the śhuddhadvait-vād system of philosophy.

That is why, while sleeping, when we dream with our mind, in our dream state we see, hear, feel, taste, and smell, even though our gross senses are resting on the bed.  This illustrates that the gross objects of the senses also exist mentally in the subtle form.  Shree Krishna has included them here because He is referring to the entire field of activity for the soul.  Some other scriptures exclude the five sense objects while describing the body.

But when the intellect is convinced about the unattractiveness of the world, it becomes firm in its resolve.  To get this firmness, we should constantly contemplate about the miseries that are an inseparable part of life in the material world.  This is what set the Buddha on the spiritual path.  He saw a sick person, and thought, “O there is sickness in the world.  I will also have to fall sick one day.”  Then He saw an old person, and thought, “There is also old age.  This means that I will also become old one day.”  After that, He saw a dead person, and realized, “This is also a part of existence.  It means that I too will have to die one day.”  The Buddha’s intellect was so perceptive that one exposure to these facts of life made Him renounce worldly existence.  Since we do not have such decisive intellects, we must repeatedly contemplate on these facts to allow the unattractiveness of the world to sink in.",

In bodily thinking, one spontaneously identifies with the family and home as “mine.”  Thus, they linger upon the mind more often and attachment to them shackles the mind to material consciousness.  Attachment causes expectations of the kind of behavior we want from family members, and when these expectations are not met, it leads to mental anguish.  Also inevitably, there is separation from the family, either temporarily, if they go to another place, or permanently, if they die.  All these experiences and their apprehensions begin to weigh heavily upon the mind and drag it away from God.  Hence, if we seek immortal bliss, we must practice prudence while interacting with the spouse, child, and home, to prevent the mind from becoming entangled.  We must do our duty toward them, without attachment, as a nurse does her duty in the hospital, or as a teacher does her duty toward her students in the school. ",

This is possible because, just as He is all-pervading in creation, His eyes and ears are also ubiquitous.  The Chhāndogya Upaniṣhad states: sarvaṁ khalvidaṁ brahma (3.14.1)  “Everywhere is Brahman.”  Hence, He accepts food offerings made to Him anywhere in the universe; He hears the prayers of His devotees, wherever they may be; and He is the Witness of all that occurs in the three worlds.  If millions of devotees venerate Him at the same time, He has no problem in accepting the prayers of all of them.",

The Abrahamic traditions accept the existence of the soul in humans, but do not accept that other forms of life also have souls.  This concept condones violence toward the other life forms.  However, the Vedic philosophy stresses that wherever consciousness exists, there must be the presence of the soul.  Without it, there can be no consciousness.  ",

His experiments proved that soothing music can enhance the growth of plants.  When a hunter shoots a bird sitting on a tree, the vibrations of the tree seem to indicate that it weeps for the bird.  And when a loving gardener enters the garden, the trees feel joyous.  The changes in the vibrations of the tree reveal that it also possesses consciousness and can experience semblances of emotions.  These observations corroborate Shree Krishna’s statement here that all life forms possess consciousness; they are the combination of the eternal soul, which is the source of consciousness, and the body, which is made of the insentient material energy.",

Yet, it cannot shrug the responsibility of the actions performed by the body.  Just as the President is responsible for the decision of the country to go to war, although he does not fight in it himself, similarly, the soul is responsible for the actions of a living entity, even though they are performed by the body, mind, and intellect.  That is why a spiritual aspirant must keep both sides in mind.  Maharishi Vasishth instructed Ram: kartā bahirkartāntarloke vihara rāghava (Yog Vāsiṣhṭh)  “Ram, while working, externally exert Yourself as if the results depend upon You; but internally, realize Yourself to be the non-doer.”",

Similarly, there are numerous forms of life in existence, from the tiniest amoeba to the most powerful celestial gods.  All of them are rooted in the same reality—the soul, which is a part of God, seated in a body, which is made from the material energy.  The distinctions between the forms are not due to the soul, but due to the different bodies manifested by the material energy.  Upon birth, the bodies of all living beings are created from the material energy, and at death, their bodies again merge into it.  When we see the variety of living beings all rooted in the same material nature, we realize the unity behind the diversity.

      "The previous chapter explained in detail the distinction between the soul and the material body. This chapter describes the nature of the material energy, which is the source of the body and its elements, and is thus the origin of both mind and matter. Shree Krishna explains that material nature is constituted of three modes (guṇas)—goodness, passion, and ignorance. The body, mind, and intellect that are made from the material energy also possess these three modes, and the mix of the modes in our being determines the color of our personality. The mode of goodness is characterized by peacefulness, well-being, virtue, and serenity; the mode of passion gives rise to endless desires and insatiable ambitions for worldly enhancement; and the mode of ignorance is the cause for delusion, laziness, intoxication, and sleep. Until the soul attains illumination, it must learn to deal with these three powerful forces of material nature. Liberation lies in transcending all three of these modes.",
      "Shree Krishna reveals a simple solution for breaking out of the bondage of these guṇas. The Supreme Lord is transcendental to the three modes, and if we attach ourselves to him, then our mind will also rise to the divine platform. At this point, Arjun enquires about the characteristics of those who have gone beyond the three guṇas. Shree Krishna then systematically explains the traits of such liberated souls. He explains that illumined persons remain ever equipoised; they are not disturbed when they see the guṇas functioning in the world, and their effects manifesting in persons, objects, and situations. They see everything as a manifestation of God’s energies, which are ultimately in his hands. Thus, worldly situations neither make them jubilant nor miserable, and without wavering, they remain established in the self. The chapter ends with Shree Krishna again reminding us of the power of devotion and its ability to make us transcend the three guṇas."

In this chapter, he goes on to elaborate in detail about the three-fold qualities of material nature (the guṇas).

During dissolution, souls who are vimukh (have their backs) toward God remain in a state of suspended animation within the body of Maha Vishnu. The material energy, prakṛiti, also lies unmanifest in God’s mahodar (big stomach). When he desires to activate the process of creation, he glances at prakṛiti. It then begins to unwind, and sequentially, the entities mahān, ahankār, pañch-tanmātrās, and pañch-mahābhūta are created. Also, with the help of the secondary creator Brahma, the material energy creates various life forms, and God casts the souls into appropriate bodies, determined by their past karmas. Thus, Shree Krishna states that prakṛiti is like the womb and the souls are like the sperms. He places the souls in the womb of Mother Nature to give birth to multitudes of living beings.

However, those in goodness can easily become complacent and feel no urge to progress to the transcendental platform. Also, sattva guṇa illumines the intellect with knowledge. If this is not accompanied by spiritual wisdom, then knowledge results in pride and that pride comes in the way of devotion to God. This is often seen in the case of scientists, academicians, scholars, etc. The mode of goodness usually predominates in them, since they spend their time and energy cultivating knowledge.

People influenced by it are inclined toward intellectual pursuits and virtuous ideas. Thus, the mode of goodness promotes wise actions. Rajo guṇa inflames the senses, and puts the mind out of control, sending it into a spin of ambitious desires. The living being is trapped by it and over-endeavors for wealth and pleasures that are meaningless from the perspective of the soul. Tamo guṇa covers the living being with inertia and nescience.

They are not disturbed when they see the guṇas functioning in the world, and their effects manifesting in persons, objects, and situations around them. Illumined persons do not hate ignorance when they see it, nor get implicated in it. Worldly-minded become overly concerned with the condition of the world. They spend their time and energy brooding about the state of things in the world. The enlightened souls also strive for human welfare, but they do so because it is their nature to help others. At the same time, they realize that the world is ultimately in the hands of God. They simply have to do their duty to the best of their ability, and leave the rest in the hands of God. Having come into God’s world, our first duty is how to purify ourselves. Then, with a pure mind, we will naturally do good and beneficial works in the world, without allowing worldly situations to bear too heavily upon us.

In fact, even when they perceive these guṇas in their mind, they do not feel disturbed. The mind is made from the material energy, and thus contains the three modes of Maya. So it is natural for the mind to be subjected to the influence of the guṇas, and their corresponding thoughts. The problem is that in bodily consciousness we do not see the mind as different from ourselves. And so, when the mind presents a disturbing thought, we feel, “Oh! I am thinking in this negative manner.” We begin to associate with the poisonous thoughts, allowing them to reside in us and damage us spiritually. To the extent that even if the mind presents a thought against God and Guru, we accept the thought as ours. If, at that time, we could see the mind as separate from us, we would be able to dissociate ourselves from negative thoughts. We would then reject the thoughts of the mind, “I will have nothing to do with any thought that is not conducive to my devotion.” Persons on the transcendental platform have mastered the art of distancing themselves from all negative thoughts arising in the mind from the flow of the guṇas.",

Such self-realized mystics do perceive the dualities of the world but remain unaffected by them. Thus, they become nirguṇa (beyond the influence of the guṇas). This gives them an equal vision, with which they see a piece of stone, a lump of earth, gold, favorable and unfavorable situations, criticisms and glorifications as all the same.",

    "description": [
      "In the previous chapter, Shree Krishna explained that by transcending the three modes of material nature one attains the divine goal.  He also revealed that the best means for going beyond the guṇas is to engage in exclusive devotion.  To engage in such devotion, we must detach the mind from the world and attach it to God alone.  Thus, it is necessary to understand the nature of the world.  In this chapter, Shree Krishna explains this material world in a graphic manner, to help Arjun develop detachment from it.   He compares the material world to an upside down aśhvatth tree (sacred fig).  The embodied soul wanders up and down the branches of the tree, from lifetime to lifetime, without comprehending from where it originated, how long it has existed, and how it keeps growing.  The roots of the tree are above, as it has its source in God.  The fruitive activities described in the Vedas are like its leaves.  The tree is irrigated by the three modes of material nature.  These modes create sense objects that are like the buds on the tree.  The buds sprout aerial roots that engender further growth of the tree.  The chapter describes this symbolism in detail, to convey the idea of how the embodied soul suffering in this material world only keeps perpetuating its bondage here, in ignorance of the nature of this tree of material existence.  Shree Krishna explains that the axe of detachment must be used to cut down the tree.  Then, we must search for the base of the tree, which is the Supreme Lord Himself.  Finding the source, we must surrender to Him in the manner described in this chapter, and then will attain the divine Abode of God, from where we will not return to the material world again.  ",
      "Shree Krishna then describes how the souls in this world are divine, being His eternal fragmental parts.  But bound by material nature, they are struggling with the six senses including the mind.  He explains how the embodied soul, though divine, savors the material objects of the senses.  He also describes how the soul transmigrates to a new body at the time of death, carrying with it the mind and senses from the present life.  The ignorant neither realize the presence of the soul in the body, nor when it departs from it upon death.  But yogis perceive it with the eyes of knowledge and by the purity of their mind.  In the same way, God is also present in His creation, but He needs to be perceived with the eyes of knowledge.  Shree Krishna reveals how we can cognize the existence of God in this world through His glories that shine forth everywhere.  The chapter ends with explanations of the terms: kṣhar, akṣhar, and Puruṣhottam.  Kṣhar are the perishable beings of the material realm.  Akṣhar are the liberated beings in the Abode of God.  Puruṣhottam is the Supreme Divine Personality, who is the unchanging controller and sustainer of the world.  He is transcendental to both the perishable and imperishable beings.  He must be worshipped with all our being."

      "In this chapter, Shree Krishna describes the two kinds of natures amongst human beings—the saintly and the demoniac. The saintly nature develops by following the instructions of the scriptures, cultivating the mode of goodness, and purifying the mind through spiritual practices. It leads to the enhancement of daivī sampatti (godly qualities), eventually culminating in God-realization. In contrast, there is also the demoniac nature that develops from associating with the modes of passion and ignorance, and embracing materialistic views. It breeds unwholesome traits in one’s personality, and eventually throws the soul into hellish kinds of existence.",
      "The chapter begins by describing the saintly virtues of those endowed with a divine nature. It then goes on to describe the demoniac qualities that must be scrupulously shunned because they drag the soul further into ignorance and the samsara of life and death. Shree Krishna concludes the chapter by saying that the scriptures should be our authority in determining what should be done and what should not be done. We must understand these scriptural injunctions and then perform our actions in this world accordingly."

    "description": [
      "In the fourteenth chapter, Shree Krishna had explained the three modes of material nature and the manner in which they hold sway over humans. In this seventeenth chapter, he goes into greater detail about the influence of the guṇas. First, he discusses the topic of faith and explains that nobody is devoid of faith, for it is an inseparable aspect of human nature. But depending upon the nature of their mind, people’s faith takes on a corresponding color—sāttvic, rājasic, or tāmasic. The nature of their faith determines the quality of their life. People also prefer food according to their dispositions. Shree Krishna classifies food into three categories and discusses the impact of each of these upon us. He then moves on to the topic of sacrifice (yajña) and how, in each of the three modes of nature, sacrifice takes on different forms. The chapter moves on to the subject of austerity (tapaḥ), and explains austerities of the body, speech, and mind. Each of these kinds of austerity takes on a different form as influenced by the mode of goodness, passion, or ignorance. The topic of charity (dān) is then discussed, and its three-fold divisions are described.",
      "Finally, Shree Krishna goes beyond the three guṇas and explains the relevance and import of the words “Om Tat Sat,” which symbolize different aspects of the Absolute Truth. The syllable “Om” is a symbolic representation of the impersonal aspect of God; the syllable “Tat” is uttered for consecrating activities and ceremonies to the Supreme Lord; the syllable “Sat” means eternal goodness and virtue. Taken together, they usher the concept of transcendence. The chapter concludes by emphasizing the futility of acts of sacrifice, austerity, and charity, which are done without regard to the injunctions of the scriptures."

    "description": [
      "The final chapter of the Bhagavad Gita is the longest and covers many subjects. Arjun initiates the topic of renunciation with a question about two commonly used Sanskrit words, sanyās (renunciation of actions) and tyāg (renunciation of desires). Both words come from roots words meaning “to abandon.” A sanyāsī (monk) is one who does not participate in family life and withdraws from society to practice sādhanā (spiritual discipline). A tyāgī is one who engages in activities but gives up selfish desire for enjoying the rewards of actions (this is the connotation of the word in the Gita). Shree Krishna recommends the second kind of renunciation. He advises that sacrifice, charity, penance, and other acts of duty should never be renounced, for they purify even the wise. Rather, they should be performed as a matter of duty simply because they ought to be done, without any attachment to the fruits of these actions.",
      "Then, Shree Krishna goes into a detailed analysis of the three factors that motivate action, the three constituents of action, and the five factors that contribute to the result of action. He describes each of these in terms of the three guṇas. He establishes that those with deficient understanding see themselves as the only cause of their works. But the enlightened souls, with purified intellect, neither consider themselves as the doer nor the enjoyer of their actions. Ever detached from the fruits of what they do, they are not bound in karmic reactions. The chapter then explains why people differ in their motives and activities. According to the three modes of material nature, it describes the kinds of knowledge, the types of actions, and the categories of performers. It then offers the same analysis for the intellect, resolve, and happiness. The chapter then goes on to paint a picture of those who have attained perfection in spiritual life and are situated in Brahman-realization. It adds that even such perfect yogis find completion in their realization by engaging in bhakti. Thus, the secret of the Supreme Divine Personality can only be known through loving devotion.",
      "Shree Krishna then reminds Arjun that God dwells in the hearts of all living beings, and directs their wanderings according to their karmas. If we remember him and dedicate all our activities to him, taking shelter of him and making him our supreme goal, then by his grace we will overcome all obstacles and difficulties. But if, motivated by pride, we act according to our whims, we will not attain success. Finally, Shree Krishna reveals that the most confidential knowledge is to abandon all varieties of religiosity and simply surrender to God. However, this knowledge should not be given to those who are not austere or devoted, for they will misinterpret it and mis-utilize it to irresponsibly abandon actions. But if we explain this confidential knowledge to qualified souls, it is the greatest act of love and is very pleasing to God.",
      "Arjun then informs Shree Krishna that his illusion is dispelled and he is ready to act as instructed. In the end, Sanjay, who has been narrating the dialogue to the blind king Dhritarashtra remarks how amazed and astounded he is on hearing the divine conversation. His hair stands on end in ecstasy, as he recalls the sacred dialogue and remembers the stupendous cosmic form of God. He concludes with a profound pronouncement that victory will always be on the side of God and his pure devotee, and so will goodness, supremacy, and opulence, for the darkness of falsehood will always be vanquished by the light of the Absolute Truth."
