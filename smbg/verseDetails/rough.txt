kāmaiḥ—by material desires; taiḥ taiḥ—by various; hṛita-jñānāḥ—whose knowledge has been carried away; prapadyante—surrender; anya—to other; devatāḥ—celestial gods; tam tam—the various; niyamam—rules and regulations; āsthāya—following; prakṛityā—by nature; niyatāḥ—controlled; svayā—by their own
Translation
BG 7.20: Those whose knowledge has been carried away by material desires surrender to the celestial gods. Following their own nature, they worship the devatās, practicing rituals meant to propitiate these celestial personalities.

Commentary
Shree Krishna says that people worship the devatās (celestial gods) as per the prescribed rituals to attain material gains. Material desires have shrouded their knowledge. Hence, they forget that the Supreme Lord is the source of all that exists, including these celestial gods. As a president of a country appoints his officers among different departments. Similarly, these celestial gods also occupy different positions in the working of God’s creation. They derive their powers from God; they are not independent of Him. They can bestow on their devotees only material things that are under their control. But cannot liberate anyone from the bondage of Maya or the cycle of birth and death because; they themselves are not liberated from this cycle. God alone has the power to do so. The celestial gods are also souls like us. However, they have attained these positions in the celestial abodes as a result of their pious deeds from previous lives. Once their account of pious deeds depletes, they have to return to earth. Hence, even the celestial gods are perishable; God alone is eternal.

yaḥ yaḥ—whoever; yām yām—whichever; tanum—form; bhaktaḥ—devotee; śhraddhayā—with faith; architum—to worship; ichchhati—desires; tasya tasya—to him; achalām—steady; śhraddhām—faith; tām—in that; eva—certainly; vidadhāmi—bestow; aham—I
Translation
BG 7.21: Whatever celestial form a devotee seeks to worship with faith, I steady the faith of such a devotee in that form.

Commentary
We find countless devotees around us engaging in devotion toward the celestial gods, with unflinching faith and wonder, how people develop such high faith in the lower form of worship? In this verse, Shree Krishna answers this and says that He is the creator of the faith in the celestial gods as well. When He finds people worshiping the devatās for the fulfillment of their material desires, He helps them in their devotion and steadies their faith. The ability to create śhraddhā or faith is beyond the capacity of the celestial gods; it is the indwelling Paramātmā or the Supreme Soul who inspires faith in the hearts of the devotees.  Later in the Bhagavad Gita verse 15.15, He states, “I am seated in the hearts of all living beings, and from me come memory, knowledge, and understanding.”

Shree Krishna had earlier mentioned that those who are in true-knowledge engage in the highest and the most beneficial kind of śhraddhā that is to worship the Supreme Lord. Then one might ask, why the Supreme Lord creates faith in people toward the celestial gods—is it not inappropriate?

Let us look at this example of parents giving dolls to their small children. The child plays with these dolls as if they were real people and develops love and affection towards them. The parents are aware of the child’s innocence, yet they encourage this play to help the child develop the qualities of love, care, and affection towards other people. These qualities will help children become socially responsible when they grow up.

Similarly, our eternal parent God is aware of our ignorance. Hence, when He finds that some souls engage in worship of the celestial gods for material gains, He helps them by steading their faith. He is aware that this experience will help in the evolution of the soul, and once they acquire true-knowledge that the Supreme Lord is the summum bonum or the highest good of everything, they will surrender to Him.

Translation
BG 7.22: Endowed with faith, the devotee worships a particular celestial god and obtains the objects of desire. But in reality, I alone arrange these benefits.

Commentary
Shree Krishna reiterates in this verse that the celestial gods do not have the capacity to fulfill the material desires of their devotees. They can only grant wishes if God permits it. Labhate means “to obtain.” The devotees with mediocre understanding may think that they have obtained their desired material objects by pleasing the devatās (celestial gods). However, it is not the devatās, but God who facilitates everything.

Translation
BG 7.23: But the fruit gained by these people of small understanding is perishable. Those who worship the celestial gods go to the celestial abodes, while my devotees come to me.

Commentary
Continuing from the previous verses, Shree Krishna explains to Arjun the spiritual principle that is: “One attains the object of one’s worship. People who worship the devatās go to the planets of the respective devatās upon death. Whereas, those who are devoted to me come to my abode.”  Now, the question comes up again, when reaching God is the ultimate destination, then why does God steady the faith of those devotees who worship the celestial gods?

Consider the example of our education system, where students start with primary school but cannot stay at that level forever. The teachers encourage them and coach them to move to the next level. Even though primary school is necessary, students outgrow that and keep moving higher and higher. Similarly, the Bhagavad Gita is not for the primary school students or the novices who wish to attain the celestial abodes. But for those devotees who are seeking a higher purpose.

Since the devatās are perishable, the fruits they bestow on their devotees are also perishable. However, God is imperishable, and the fruits of his worship are also ever-lasting. Those who worship the eternal form of God, upon death, attain His eternal abode and stay there forever in His service.

avyaktaṁ vyaktim āpannaṁ manyante mām abuddhayaḥ
paraṁ bhāvam ajānanto mamāvyayam anuttamam

avyaktam—formless; vyaktim—possessing a personality; āpannam—to have assumed; manyante—think; mām—me; abuddhayaḥ—less intelligent; param—Supreme; bhāvam—nature; ajānantaḥ—not understanding; mama—my; avyayam—imperishable; anuttamam—excellent
Translation
BG 7.24: The less intelligent think that I, the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna, was formless earlier and have now assumed this personality. They do not understand the imperishable exalted nature of my personal form.

Commentary
People often vehemently debate upon the Supreme Lord being a formless God, while the others claim He exists in His personal-form. Even those who agree to both aspects of God’s personality are sometimes confused. Which of them precedes the other, and which of them is the original God? Did the personal form of God manifest from the formless, or is it the other way round? We have discussed this earlier in the commentary for Verses 4.5 and 4.6 as well.

Here in this verse, Shree Krishna resolves this debate by stating that God exists in the spiritual realm eternally in His divine form. The ignorant do not understand the magnificent and imperishable nature of His personal-form. The divine personality of God has not manifested from the formless Brahman; it is primordial. The divine light that emanates from His transcendental body is the formless Brahman.

The Padma Purāṇ states:

yannakhenduruchir brahma dhyeyaṁ brahmādibhiḥ suraiḥ
guṇatrayamatītaṁ taṁ vande vṛindāvaneśhvaram
(Patal Khand 77.60) [v21]

“The light that emanates from the toenails of God’s personality is worshipped as the Brahman by the jñānīs.”

Therefore, there is no difference between the two forms. Neither of them is superior or inferior. In God’s personal-form, His name, form, virtues, abode, pastimes, associates, etc., manifest as an extension of His divine energy. However, in the formless Brahman, even though all the divine potencies and energies exist, they are in a concealed form.

na—not; aham—I; prakāśhaḥ—manifest; sarvasya—to everyone; yoga-māyā—God’s supreme (divine) energy; samāvṛitaḥ—veiled; mūḍhaḥ—deluded; ayam—these; na—not; abhijānāti—know; lokaḥ—persons; mām—me; ajam—unborn; avyayam—immutable
Translation
BG 7.25: I am not manifest to everyone, being veiled by my divine Yogmaya energy. Hence, those without knowledge do not know that I am without birth and changeless.

Commentary
Shree Krishna had mentioned two of His divine energies earlier in this chapter, in verses 7.4 and 7.5. The eight-fold prakṛiti, or the material energy, and the jīva śhakti, or the soul energy. Now, He talks about His third and the most powerful energy that is the Yogmaya.  The Viṣhṇu Purāṇ states:

viṣhṇu śhaktiḥ parā proktā kṣhetrajñākhyā tathā ’parā
avidyā karma sanjñānyā tṛitīyā śhaktiriṣhyate
(6.7.61) [v22]

“The Supreme Lord Shree Vishnu has three main energies—Yogmaya, the souls, and Maya.”

Jagadguru Kripaluji Maharaj states:

śhaktimān kī śhaktiyāñ, aganita yadapi bakhāna
tin mahañ ‘māyā, ‘jīva, aru, ‘parā, triśhakti pradhāna
(Bhakti Śhatak verse 3) [v23]

“The Supreme Energetic Shree Krishna has infinite energies. Amongst these, Yogmaya, the souls, and Maya are the main ones.”

God descends in this world by virtue of His Yogmaya energy and reveals His divine pastimes, His divine abode, His divine bliss and love on the Earth plane. However, the same Yogmaya power keeps His divinity veiled from us. We are unable to feel His presence, although He is seated in our hearts. Even in the present, if we are fortunate enough to see the Lord in His personal-form, we cannot recognize Him. Until we are eligible for His divine vision, the Yogmaya keeps God’s divine form concealed from us. And only by God’s grace, the Yogmaya bestows upon us the divine vision that allows us to recognize and see God.

The Ramayan states:

chidānandamaya deha tumhārī, bigata bikāra jāna adhikārī  [v24]

“O God, you have a divine form. Only those whose hearts are purified can know you by your grace.”

Similar to God, His Yogmaya energy is both formless and manifests into personal forms. Radha, Sita, Lakshmi, Parvati. Durga, Kali, etc., are the divine forms of the Yogmaya energy of God. In the Vedic culture, all these forms are revered; as the Mother of the Universe. She radiates the motherly qualities of kindness, mercy, compassion, beauty, divine grace, and causeless love. Among these, the most important quality for us souls is Her divine grace with which we can acquire transcendental knowledge to know God. It is for the same reason, the devotees of Vrindavan sing, “Radhe Radhe, Shyam se milā de,” “O Radha, please bestow your grace and help me meet Shree Krishna.”

Therefore, the same Yogmaya–conceals God from the unqualified souls and bestows Her divine grace upon the surrendered souls, for they can know Him. However, those souls who are under the influence of Maya or the material energy turn their backs towards God. They remain bereft of the divine grace of His Yogmaya energy and continue living in ignorance, entangled in Maya. Others who have turned to God are in the shelter of Yogmaya and liberated from Maya.

Translation
BG 7.26: O Arjun, I know of the the past, present, and future, and I also know all living beings; but me no one knows.

Commentary
In this verse, God declares that He is trikāl-darśhī—knower of the past, present, and the future. Most of us are forgetful of even what we were thinking a few hours ago; whereas, God is omniscient. He remembers and keeps a record of the deeds, words, and even the thoughts of each individual soul of the universe throughout their life and since their infinite lifetimes. God maintains this record of the sañchit karma or the stockpile of karmas of every soul for endless lifetimes because, as the governor of the law of karma, He dispenses justice to the souls.

Shree Krishna says that He has the knowledge of everything, the past, present, and the future. However, with our finite intellect, we cannot know the Almighty God. His infinite glory, splendor, energies, qualities, and extent are beyond the comprehension of our inadequate intellect.

The Vedic scriptures state:

yaḥ sarvajñaḥ sarvavidyasya jñānamayaṁ tapaḥ  (Muṇḍakopaniṣhad 1.1.9) [v25]

“God is all-knowing and omniscient. His austerity consists of knowledge.”

naiṣhā tarkeṇa matirāpaneyā  (Kaṭhopaniṣhad 1.2.9) [v26]

“God is beyond the scope of our intellectual logic.”

yato vācho nivartante aprāpya manasā saha  (Taittirīya Upaniṣhad 2.9.1) [v27]

“Our mind and words cannot reach God.”

rām atarkya buddhi mana bānī, mata hamāra asa sunahi sayānī  (Ramayan) [v28]

“God cannot be analyzed by arguments or reached by words, mind, and intellect.”

Only God knows Himself. However, if He finds some eligible soul, He bestows His grace upon that fortunate soul, and then with God’s divine intellect, the soul gets to know God. Therefore, only by God’s grace one can know God. Our material intellect does not have the capacity to know Him otherwise. The concept of God’s grace is discussed again in detail in 10.11 and 18.58.

ichchhā—desire; dveṣha—aversion; samutthena—arise from; dvandva—of duality; mohena—from the illusion; bhārata—Arjun, descendant of Bharat; sarva—all; bhūtāni—living beings; sammoham—into delusion; sarge—since birth; yānti—enter; parantapa—Arjun, conqueror of enemies
Translation
BG 7.27: O descendant of Bharat, the dualities of desire and aversion arise from illusion. O conqueror of enemies, all living beings in the material realm are from birth deluded by these.

Commentary
Having given a glimpse of His omniscience in the previous verse, Shree Krishna now goes back to a subject He had covered earlier about the dualities in the world. Happiness and distress, pleasure and pain, summer and winter, night and day, etc., all these dualities exist in pairs. These dualities are an inseparable part of life’s experiences. However, the most deluding dualities in life are birth and death. The arena of one’s life exists between the two ends of birth and death. From the very moment a living creature is born, death is inevitable, and again comes a subsequent-birth.

Our material intellect believes that worldly pleasures will give us happiness and fulfillment. Therefore, in material consciousness, while we desire the favorable ones, we detest the unpleasant experiences. Although attraction and aversion are not the inherent qualities of these dualities, they develop due to our ignorance. Our intellect does not realize that materially pleasurable situations will only increase our material illusion. Thus, it makes us believe that pain is detrimental to us. However, adversities have the potential of dispelling that material illusion from our mind and elevate our soul. Our ignorance is the root cause of our delusions. A spiritually elevated person accepts these dualities as inseparable aspects of God’s creation and rises above likes and dislikes, attraction and aversion, etc.

Translation
BG 7.28: But persons, whose sins have been destroyed by engaging in pious activities, become free from the illusion of dualities. Such persons worship me with determination.

Commentary
Shree Krishna says that those souls who have freed their minds from the dualities of hatred and desire worship him with unshakeable determination. They neither seek pleasure in the material world nor feel an aversion for pain. They are cautious while indulging in worldly pleasures as it may again delude their soul. Earlier, in verse 2.69, Shree Krishna had said, “What the ignorant consider as night, the wise consider as day.” Such devotees, who aspire to attain God-realization, look upon adversities as an opportunity for spiritual growth and renunciation.

Translation
BG 7.29: Those who take shelter in me, striving for liberation from old-age and death, come to know Brahman, the individual self, and the entire field of karmic action.

Commentary
Shree Krishna had mentioned earlier in verse 7.26 that no one can know God by the strength of their own intellect. However, in this verse, He says that God can be known—only by virtue of His grace. Those devotees who surrender to Him completely—receive His divine grace. The Kaṭhopaniṣhad states:

nāyamātmā pravachanena labhyo  na medhayā na bahunā śhrutena
yamevaiṣha vṛiṇute tena labhya-stasyaiṣha ātmā vivṛiṇute tanūṁ svām
(1.2.23) [v29]

“God cannot be known—through spiritual discourses nor the intellect nor hearing various kinds of teachings. Only when He bestows His grace upon someone does that fortunate soul come to know Him.”

The Vedas state:                    ekasmin vijñāte sarvamidaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavati   [v30]

“If you know God, you will know everything.”

Although some spiritual seekers consider ātma-jñāna, or knowledge of the self, as the ultimate goal of human birth, it is only a tiny drop in the ocean of knowledge, which is brahma-jñāna or the knowledge of God. By just knowing a drop, one cannot understand the enormity, depth, or prowess of the ocean. Therefore, ātma-jñāna cannot be in any way equal to brahma-jñāna. However, it can be a starting point toward the absolute.

According to the Vedas, absolute knowledge is—the Knowledge of God. If you know God, everything related to Him; is also revealed, and all your ignorance disappears. Shree Krishna states that those who take His shelter are liberated from the cycle of birth and death forever. And by His divine grace, they receive brahma-jñāna or knowledge of the Brahman, ātma-jñāna or knowledge of the self and the entire field of karmic action or the divine laws of karma.

Translation
BG 7.30: Those who know me as the governing principle of the adhibhūta (field of matter) and the adhidaiva (the celestial gods), and as adhiyajña (the Lord of all sacrificial performances), such enlightened souls are in full consciousness of me even at the time of death.

Commentary
In this verse, Shree Krishna mentions that those enlightened souls who know Him are truly devoted to Him, and even at the time of their death, they are in full consciousness of Him. Such true devotees attain His divine abode. But how can one remember God even at the time of death? Death is said to be a very painful journey, comparable to 2000 scorpions biting at the same time. Such extreme pain is beyond the tolerance of any normal human; a person loses consciousness; the mind and the intellect stop working much before the end. One cannot remember anything in that state. Where is the question of remembering God? How do they do it then?

Those enlightened beings who have attained true knowledge are ever filled with devotion to God, their mind and intellect, all surrendered and attached to Him alone. Thus, their bodies are beyond pleasure and pain even at the time of death. Their soul is completely disconnected from lamentation and hankering at the material level because it is no longer in bodily consciousness.  

Shree Krishna has explained the words adhibhūta, adhidaiva, and adhiyajña in the next chapter.

Who is Adhiyajña in the body and how is He the Adhiyajña? O Krishna, how are You to be known at the time of death by those of steadfast mind?

Commentary
At the conclusion of Chapter seven, Shree Krishna had introduced terms like Brahman, adhibhūta, adhiyātma, adhidaiva, and adhiyajña.  Arjun is curious to learn more about these terms, consequently he raises seven questions in these two verses.  Six of these questions relate to the terms mentioned by Shree Krishna.  The seventh question is about the time of death.  Shree Krishna had Himself raised the topic in verse 7.30.  Arjun now wishes to know how one can remember God at the moment of death.

Translation
BG 8.3: The Blessed Lord said: The Supreme Indestructible Entity is called Brahman; one’s own self is called adhyātma. Actions pertaining to the material personality of living beings, and its development are called karma, or fruitive activities.

Commentary
Shree Krishna says that the Supreme Entity is called Brahman (in the Vedas, God is referred to by many Names and Brahman is one of them).  It is beyond space, time, and the chain of cause and effect.  These are the characteristics of the material realm, while Brahman is transcendental to the material plane.  It is unaffected by the changes in the universe, and is imperishable.  Hence, It is described as akṣharam.  In the Bṛihadāraṇyak Upaniṣhad 3.8.8, Brahman has been described in the same manner:  “Learned people speak of Brahman as akṣhar (indestructible).  It is also designated as Param (Supreme) because It possesses qualities beyond those possessed by Maya and the souls.”

The path of spirituality is called adhyātma, and science of the soul is also called adhyātma.  But here the word has been used for one’s own self, which includes the soul, body, mind, and intellect.

Karma is actions performed by the self, which forge the individual’s unique conditions of existence from birth to birth.  These karmas keep the soul rotating in samsara (the cycle of material existence).

Translation
BG 8.4: O best of the embodied souls, the physical manifestation that is constantly changing is called adhibhūta; the universal form of God, which presides over the celestial gods in this creation, is called adhidaiva; I, who dwell in the heart of every living being, am called Adhiyajña, or the Lord of all sacrifices.

Commentary
The kaleidoscope of the universe, consisting of all manifestations of the five elements—earth, water, fire, air, space—is called adhibhūta.  The virāṭ puruṣh, which is the complete cosmic personality of God encompassing the entire material creation, is called adhidaiva because He has sovereignty over the devatās (the celestial gods who administer the different departments of the universe).  The Supreme Divine Personality, Shree Krishna, who dwells in the heart of all living beings as the Paramātmā (Supreme Soul) is called Adhiyajña.  All yajñas (sacrifices) are to be performed for His satisfaction.  He is thus the presiding divinity over all the yajñas and the one who bestows rewards for all actions. 

This verse and the previous one answer six of Arjun’s seven questions, which are more in regard to terminology.  The next few verses answer the question regarding the moment of death.

अन्तकाले च मामेव स्मरन्मुक्त्वा कलेवरम् |
य: प्रयाति स मद्भावं याति नास्त्यत्र संशय: || 5||

anta-kāle cha mām eva smaran muktvā kalevaram
yaḥ prayāti sa mad-bhāvaṁ yāti nāstyatra sanśhayaḥ

anta-kāle—at the time of death; cha—and; mām—Me; eva—alone; smaran—remembering; muktvā—relinquish; kalevaram—the body; yaḥ—who; prayāti—goes; saḥ—he; mat-bhāvam—Godlike nature; yāti—achieves; na—no; asti—there is; atra—here; sanśhayaḥ—doubt
Translation
BG 8.5: Those who relinquish the body while remembering Me at the moment of death will come to Me. There is certainly no doubt about this.

Commentary
In the next verse, Shree Krishna will state the principle that one’s next birth is determined by one’s state of consciousness at the time of death and the object of one’s absorption.  So if, at the time of death, one is absorbed in the transcendental Names, Forms, Virtues, Pastimes, and Abodes of God, one will attain the cherished goal of God-realization.  Shree Krishna uses the words mad bhāvaṁ, which mean “Godlike nature.”  Thus, if one’s consciousness is absorbed in God at the moment of death, one attains Him, and becomes God-like in character.


====================================================================


यं यं वापि स्मरन्भावं त्यजत्यन्ते कलेवरम् |
तं तमेवैति कौन्तेय सदा तद्भावभावित: || 6||

yaṁ yaṁ vāpi smaran bhāvaṁ tyajatyante kalevaram
taṁ tam evaiti kaunteya sadā tad-bhāva-bhāvitaḥ

yam yam—whatever; vā—or; api—even; smaran—remembering; bhāvam—remembrance; tyajati—gives up; ante—in the end; kalevaram—the body; tam—to that; tam—to that; eva—certainly; eti—gets; kaunteya—Arjun, the son of Kunti; sadā—always; tat—that; bhāva-bhāvitaḥ—absorbed in contemplation
Translation
BG 8.6: Whatever one remembers upon giving up the body at the time of death, O son of Kunti, one attains that state, being always absorbed in such contemplation.

Commentary
We may succeed in teaching a parrot to say “Good morning!”  But if we press its throat hard, it will forget what it has artificially learnt and make its natural sound “Kaw!”  Similarly, at the time of death, our mind naturally flows through the channels of thoughts it has created through lifelong habit.  The time to decide our travel plans is not when our baggage is already packed; rather, it requires careful planning and execution beforehand.  Whatever prominently dominates one’s thoughts at the moment of death will determine one’s next birth.  This is what Shree Krishna states in this verse. 

One’s final thoughts will naturally be determined by what was constantly contemplated and meditated upon during the span of life, as influenced by one's daily habits and associations.  The Puranas relate the story of Maharaj Bharat.  He was a king, but he renounced his kingdom to live in the forest as an ascetic and pursue God-realization.  One day, he saw a pregnant deer jump into the water on hearing a tiger roar.  Out of fear, the pregnant deer delivered a baby deer that began floating on the water.  Bharat felt pity on the baby deer and rescued it.  He took it to his hut and began bringing it up.  With great affection, he would watch its frolicking movements.  He would gather grass to feed it, and would hug it to keep it warm.  Slowly, his mind came away from God and became absorbed in the deer.  The absorption became so deep that, practically all day long, his thoughts would wander toward the deer.  When he was about to die, he called out to the deer in fond remembrance, concerned about what would happen to him.  Consequently, in his next life, Maharaj Bharat became a deer.  However, because he had performed spiritual sādhanā, he was aware of the mistake in his previous life, and so even as a deer, he would reside near the āśhrams of saintly persons in the forest.  Finally, when he gave up the deer body, he was again given a human birth.  This time, he became the great sage Jadabharat, and attained God-realization by completing his sādhanā.

One should not conclude upon reading the verse, that for the attainment of the ultimate goal, the Supreme Lord is only to be meditated upon at the moment of death.  This is well-nigh impossible without a lifetime of preparation.  The Skand Purāṇ states that at the time of death it is exceedingly difficult to remember God.  Death is such a painful experience, that the mind naturally gravitates to the thoughts that constitute one’s inner nature.  For the mind to think of God requires one’s inner nature to be united with Him.  The inner nature is the consciousness that abides within one’s mind and intellect.  Only if we contemplate something continuously does it manifest as a part of our inner nature.  So to develop a God-consciousness inner nature, the Lord must be remembered, recollected, and contemplated upon at every moment of our life.  This is what Shree Krishna states in the next verse.

तस्मात्सर्वेषु कालेषु मामनुस्मर युध्य च |

tasmāt sarveṣhu kāleṣhu mām anusmara yudhya cha
mayyarpita-mano-buddhir mām evaiṣhyasyasanśhayam

tasmāt—therefore; sarveṣhu—in all; kāleṣhu—times; mām—Me; anusmara—remember; yudhya—fight; cha—and; mayi—to Me; arpita—surrender; manaḥ—mind; buddhiḥ—intellect; mām—to Me; eva—surely; eṣhyasi—you shall attain; asanśhayaḥ—without a doubt
Translation
BG 8.7: Therefore, always remember Me and also do your duty of fighting the war. With mind and intellect surrendered to Me, you will definitely attain Me; of this, there is no doubt.

Commentary
The first line of this verse is the essence of teachings of the Bhagavad Gita.  It has the power of making our life divine.  It also encapsulates the definition of karm-yog.  Shree Krishna says, “Keep your mind attached to Me, and do your worldly duty with your body.”  This applies to people in all walks of life—doctors, engineers, advocates, housewives, students, etc.  In Arjun’s specific case, he is a warrior and his duty is to fight.  So he is being instructed to fulfill his duty, while keeping his mind in God.  Some people neglect their worldly duties on the plea that they have taken to spiritual life.  Others excuse themselves from spiritual practice on the pretext of worldly engagements.  People believe that spiritual and material pursuits are irreconcilable.  But God’s message is to sanctify one’s entire life.

When we practice such karm-yog, the worldly works will not suffer because the body is being engaged in them.  But since the mind is attached to God, these works will not bind one in the law of karma.  Only those works result in karmic reactions which are performed with attachment.  When that attachment does not exist, even worldly law does not hold one culpable.  For example, let us say that one man killed another and is brought to court.  The judge asks him, “Did you kill that man?”  The man replies, “Yes, your honor, there is no need for any witness.  I confess that I killed him.”  “Then you should be punished!”  “No, your honor, you cannot punish me.”  “Why?”  “I had no intention to kill.  I was driving the car on the proper side of the road, within speed limits, with my eyes focused ahead.  My brakes, steering, everything was perfect.  That man suddenly ran in front of my car.  What could I do?”  If his attorney can establish that the intention to kill did not exist, the judge will let him off without even the slightest punishment.    

From the above example we see that even in the world we are not culpable for those actions we perform without attachment.  The same principle holds for the law of karma as well.  That is why, during the Mahabharat war, following Shree Krishna’s instructions, Arjun did his duty on the battlefield.  By the end of the war, Shree Krishna noted that Arjun did not accrue any bad karma.  He would have been entangled in karma if he had been fighting the battle with attachment, for worldly gain or fame.  However, his mind was attached to Shree Krishna, and so what he was doing was multiplication in zeros, performing his duty in this world without selfish attachment.  Even if you multiply one million with zero, the answer will still be zero.

The condition for karm-yog has been stated very clearly in this verse:  The mind must be constantly engaged in thinking of God.  The moment the mind forgets God, it comes under the attack of the big generals of Maya’s army—lust, anger, greed, envy, hatred, etc.  Thus, it is important to always keep it attached to God.  Often people claim to be karm yogis because they say they do both—karm and yog.  For the major part of the day, they do karm, and for a few minutes they do yog (meditation on God).  But this is not the definition of karm-yog that Shree Krishna has given.  He states that 1) even while doing the work, the mind must be engaged in thinking of God, and 2) the remembrance of God must not be intermittent, but constant throughout the day.  

Saint Kabir expresses this in his famous couplet:

sumiran kī sudhi yoṅ karo, jyauṅ gāgar panihāra

bolat dolat surati meṅ, kahe kabīra vichār

“Remember God just as the village woman remembers the water pot on her head.  She speaks with others and walks on the path, but her mind keeps holding onto the pot.”

Shree Krishna explains the consequences of practicing karm-yog in the next verse.

परमं पुरुषं दिव्यं याति पार्थानुचिन्तयन् || 8||

abhyāsa-yoga-yuktena chetasā nānya-gāminā
paramaṁ puruṣhaṁ divyaṁ yāti pārthānuchintayan

abhyāsa-yoga—by practice of yog; yuktena—being constantly engaged in remembrance; chetasā—by the mind; na anya-gāminā—without deviating; paramam puruṣham—the Supreme Divine Personality; divyam—divine; yāti—one attains; pārtha—Arjun, the son of Pritha; anuchintayan—constant remembrance
Translation
BG 8.8: With practice, O Parth, when you constantly engage the mind in remembering Me, the Supreme Divine Personality, without deviating, you will certainly attain Me.

Commentary
This instruction to keep the mind always engaged in meditating upon God has been repeated numerous times in the Bhagavad Gita.  Here are a few verses:

ananya-chetāḥ satataṁ   8.14

mayyeva mana ādhatsva   12.8

teṣhāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ   10.10

The word abhyāsa means practice—the training and habituating of the mind to meditate upon God.  Such practice is to be done, not at fixed times of the day at regular intervals, but continuously, along with all the daily activities of life.   

When the mind is attached to God, it will get purified, even while performing worldly duties.  It is important to remember that what we think with our mind fashions our future, not the actions we perform with our body.  It is the mind that is to be engaged in devotion, and it is the mind that is to be surrendered to God.  And when the absorption of the consciousness in God is complete, one will receive the divine grace.  By God’s grace, one will attain liberation from material bondage, and will receive the unlimited divine bliss, divine knowledge, and divine love of God.  Such a soul will become God-realized in this body itself, and upon leaving the body, will go to the Abode of God.

Translation
BG 8.9-10: God is Omniscient, the most ancient one, the Controller, subtler than the subtlest, the Support of all, and the possessor of an inconceivable divine form; He is brighter than the sun, and beyond all darkness of ignorance. One who at the time of death, with unmoving mind attained by the practice of Yog, fixes the prāṇ (life airs) between the eyebrows, and steadily remembers the Divine Lord with great devotion, certainly attains Him.

Commentary
Meditation upon God can be of a variety of types.  One can meditate upon the Names, Forms, Qualities, Leelas, Abode, or Associates of God.  All these different aspects of the Supreme Divinity are non-different from Him.  When we attach our mind to any of these, our mind comes into the divine realm and hence becomes purified.  Hence, any or all of these can be made the object of meditation.  Here, eight qualities of the Supreme Lord have been described, which can be meditated upon.

Kavi means poet or seer, and by extension, omniscient.  As stated in verse 7.26, God knows the past, present, and future. 

Purāṇ means without beginning and the most ancient.  God is the origin of everything spiritual and material, but there is nothing from which He has originated and nothing that predates Him.

Anuśhāsitāram means the Ruler.  God is the Creator of the laws by which the universe runs; He administers its affairs, directly and through His appointed celestial gods.  Thus, everything is under His regime.

Aṇoraṇīyān means subtler than the subtlest.  The soul is subtler than matter, but God is seated within the soul, and hence He is subtler than it. 

Sarvasya Dhātā means the sustainer of all, just as the ocean is the support of the waves.

Achintya rūpa means of inconceivable form.  Since our mind can only conceive material forms, God is beyond the scope of our material mind.  However, if He bestows His grace, by His Yogmaya power He makes our mind divine in nature.  Then alone, by His grace, He becomes conceivable.

Āditya varṇa means He is resplendent like the sun. 

Tamasaḥ Parastāt means beyond the darkness of ignorance.  Just as the sun can never be covered by the clouds, even though it may seem to us that it has been obscured, similarly God can never be covered by the material energy Maya even though He may be in contact with it in the world.

In bhakti, the mind is focused upon the divine Attributes of God’s Form, Qualities, Pastimes, etc.  When bhakti is performed by itself, it is called śhuddha bhakti (pure bhakti).  When it is performed alongside with aṣhṭāṅg-yog, it is called yog-miśhra bhakti (devotion alloyed with aṣhṭāṅg-yog sādhanā).  From verses ten to thirteen, Shree Krishna describes yog-miśhra bhakti.  One of the beauties of the Bhagavad Gita is that it embraces a variety of sādhanās, thereby bringing people of diverse upbringing, backgrounds, and personalities in its embrace.  When western scholars attempt to read the Hindu scriptures without the help of a Guru, they often become confused by the variety of paths, instructions, and philosophical viewpoints in its various scriptures.  However, this variety is actually a blessing.  Because of the sanskārs (tendencies) of endless lifetimes, we all have different natures and preferences.  When four people go to buy clothes for themselves, they end up choosing different colors, styles, and fashions.  If the shop kept clothes of only one color and style, it would be unable to cater to the variety inherent in human nature.  Similarly, on the spiritual path too, people have performed various sādhanās in past lifetimes.  The Vedic scriptures embrace that variety, while simultaneously stressing bhakti (devotion to God) as the common thread that ties them all together.

In aṣhṭāṅg-yog, the life force is raised through the suṣhumṇā channel in the spinal column.  It is brought between the eyebrows, which is the region of the third eye (the inner eye).  It is then made to focus on the Supreme Lord with great devotion.

yad akṣharaṁ veda-vido vadanti

yat—which; akṣharam—Imperishable; veda-vidaḥ—scholars of the Vedas; vadanti—describe; viśhanti—enter; yat—which; yatayaḥ—great ascetics; vīta-rāgāḥ—free from attachment; yat—which; ichchhantaḥ—desiring; brahmacharyam—celibacy; charanti—practice; tat—that; te—to you; padam—goal; saṅgraheṇa—briefly; pravakṣhye—I shall explain
Translation
BG 8.11: Scholars of the Vedas describe Him as Imperishable; great ascetics practice the vow of celibacy and renounce worldly pleasures to enter into Him. I shall now explain to you briefly the path to that goal.

Commentary
God has been referred to by many Names in the Vedas.  Some of them are: Sat, Avyākṛit, Prāṇ, Indra, Dev, Brahman, Paramātmā, Bhagavān, Puruṣh.  In various places, while referring to the formless aspect of God, He has also been called by the name Akṣhar.  The word Akṣhar means “imperishable.”  The Bṛihadāraṇyak Upaniṣhad states:

etasya vā akṣharasya praśhāsane gārgi sūryachandramasau vidhṛitau tiṣhṭhataḥ   (3.8.9)

“Under the mighty control of the Imperishable, the sun and the moon are held on their course.”  In this verse, Shree Krishna describes the path of yog-miśhrā bhakti, to attain the formless aspect of God.  The word sangraheṇa means “in brief.”  He will describe the path only briefly, to avoid emphasizing it, since the path is not suitable for everyone.    

On this path, one must perform severe austerities, renouncing worldly desires, practicing brahmacharya, and living a life of rigid continence.  Brahmacharya is the vow of celibacy.  Through it, a person’s physical energy gets conserved, and then transformed through sādhanā into spiritual energy.  An aspirant who practices celibacy enhances memory power and the intellect for comprehending spiritual topics.  This has been previously explained in detail in verse 6.14.



====================================================================

sarva-dvārāṇi sanyamya mano hṛidi nirudhya cha

sarva-dvārāṇi—all gates; sanyamya—restraining; manaḥ—the mind; hṛidi—in the heart region; nirudhya—confining; cha—and; mūrdhni—in the head; ādhāya—establish; ātmanaḥ—of the self; prāṇam—the life breath; āsthitaḥ—situated (in); yoga-dhāraṇām—the yogic concentration
Translation
BG 8.12: Restraining all the gates of the body and fixing the mind in the heart region, and then drawing the life-breath to the head, one should get established in steadfast yogic concentration.

Commentary
The world enters the mind through the senses.  We first see, hear, touch, taste, and smell the objects of perception.  Then the mind dwells upon these objects.  Repeated contemplation creates attachment, which automatically creates further repetition of the thoughts in the mind.  Restraining the senses is thus an essential aspect of locking the world out of the mind.  A practitioner of meditation who neglects this point has to keep grappling with the incessant stream of worldly thoughts that the unrestrained senses create.  Hence, Shree Krishna delivers the instruction to guard the gates of the body.  The words sarva-dvārāṇi-sanyamya mean “controlling the passages that enter the body.”  This implies restricting the senses from their normal outgoing tendencies.  The words hṛidi nirudhya mean “locking the mind in the heart.”  This denotes directing devotional feelings from the mind to the akṣharam imperishable Supreme Lord enthroned there.  The words yoga-dhāraṇām mean “uniting the consciousness with God.”  This refers to meditating upon Him with complete attention.



====================================================================

ओमित्येकाक्षरं ब्रह्म व्याहरन्मामनुस्मरन् |

oṁ ityekākṣharaṁ brahma vyāharan mām anusmaran
yaḥ prayāti tyajan dehaṁ sa yāti paramāṁ gatim

om—sacred syllable representing the formless aspect of God; iti—thus; eka-akṣharam—one syllabled; brahma—the Absolute Truth; vyāharan—chanting; mām—Me (Shree Krishna); anusmaran—remembering; yaḥ—who; prayāti—departs; tyajan—quitting; deham—the body; saḥ—he; yāti—attains; paramām—the supreme; gatim—goal
Translation
BG 8.13: One who departs from the body while remembering Me, the Supreme Personality, and chanting the syllable Om, will attain the supreme goal.

Commentary
The sacred syllable Om, also called Praṇav, represents the sound manifestation of Brahman (the formless aspect of the Supreme Lord, without virtues and attributes).  Hence, it is considered imperishable like God Himself.  Since here Shree Krishna is describing the process of meditation in the context of aṣhṭāṅg-yog sādhanā, He states that one should chant the syllable “Om,” to bring the mind into focus, while practicing austerities and maintaining the vow of celibacy.  The Vedic scriptures also refer to “Om” as the anāhat nād.  It is the sound that pervades creation, and can be heard by yogis who tune in to it. 

The Bible says “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” (John 1:1)  The Vedic scriptures also state that God first created sound, from sound He created space, and then proceeded further in the process of creation.  That original sound was “Om.”  As a result, it is accorded so much of importance in the Vedic philosophy.  It is called a mahā vākya, or great sound vibration of the Vedas.  It is also called the bīja mantra, because it is often attached to the beginning of the Vedic mantras, just as hrīṁ, klīṁ, etc.  The vibrations of Om consist of three letters: A…U…M.  In the proper chanting of Om, one begins by making the sound “A” from the belly, with an open throat and mouth.  This is merged into the chanting of the sound “U” that is created from the middle of the mouth.  The sequence ends with chanting “M” with the mouth closed.  The three parts A … U … M have many meanings and interpretations.  For the devotees, Om is the name for the impersonal aspect of God. 

This Praṇav sound is the object of meditation in aṣhṭāṅg-yog.  In the path of bhakti-yog, devotees prefer to meditate upon the personal Names of the Lord, such as Ram, Krishna, Shiv, etc. because of the greater sweetness of God’s bliss in these personal Names.  The distinction is like the difference between having a baby in the womb and a baby in the lap.  The baby in the lap is a far sweeter experience than the baby in the womb.  

The final examination of our meditation is the time of death.  Those who are able to fix their consciousness upon God, despite the intense pain of death, pass this exam.  Such persons attain the Supreme destination upon leaving their body.  This is extremely difficult and requires a lifetime of practice.  In the following verse, Shree Krishna gives an easy way of gaining such mastery.



====================================================================


अनन्यचेता: सततं यो मां स्मरति नित्यश: |
तस्याहं सुलभ: पार्थ नित्ययुक्तस्य योगिन: || 14||

ananya-chetāḥ satataṁ yo māṁ smarati nityaśhaḥ
tasyāhaṁ sulabhaḥ pārtha nitya-yuktasya yoginaḥ

ananya-chetāḥ—without deviation of the mind; satatam—always; yaḥ—who; mām—Me; smarati—remembers; nityaśhaḥ—regularly; tasya—to him; aham—I; su-labhaḥ—easily attainable; pārtha—Arjun, the son of Pritha; nitya—constantly; yuktasya—engaged; yoginaḥ—of the yogis
Translation
BG 8.14: O Parth, for those yogis who always think of Me with exclusive devotion, I am easily attainable because of their constant absorption in Me.

Commentary
Throughout the Bhagavad Gita, Shree Krishna has repeatedly stressed upon devotion.  In the previous verse, Shree Krishna expounded meditation on the formless manifestation of God, devoid of attributes.  This is not only dry but also very difficult.  So now He gives an easier alternative, which is meditation upon His personal form as Krishna, Ram, Shiv, Vishnu, etc.  This includes the Names, Forms, Virtues, Pastimes, Abodes, and Associates of His supreme divine form. 

In the entire Bhagavad Gita, this is the only verse in which Shree Krishna says that He is easy to attain.  However, the condition He states is ananya-chetāḥ, which means that the mind must be exclusively absorbed in Him and Him alone.  The word ananya is very important.  Etymologically, it means na anya, or “no other.”  The mind should be attached to no one else but God alone.  This condition of exclusivity has often been repeated in the Bhagavad Gita. 

ananyāśh chintayanto māṁ   9.22

tam eva śharaṇaṁ gachchha   18.62

mām ekaṁ śharaṇaṁ vraja   18.66

Exclusive devotion has been stressed in the other scriptures too.

mām ekam eva śharaṇam ātmānaṁ sarva-dehinām   (Bhagavatam 11.12.15)

“Surrender to Me alone, who am the Supreme Soul of all living beings.”

eka bharoso eka bala ek āsa visvāsa   (Ramayan)

“I have only one support, one strength, one faith, one shelter; and that is Shree Ram.”

anyāśhrayāṇāṁ tyāgo ’nanyatā   (Nārad Bhakti Darśhan, Sūtra 10)

“Reject all other shelters, and become exclusive to God.”

Exclusive devotion means that the mind must be attached only to the Names, Forms, Virtues, Pastimes, Abodes, and Associates of God.  The logic is very simple.  The aim of sādhanā is to purify the mind, and this is accomplished only by attaching it to the all-pure God.  However, if we cleanse the mind by contemplating upon God, and then again dirty it by dipping it in worldliness, then no matter how long we try, we will never be able to clean it. 

This is exactly the mistake that many people make.  They love God but they also love and get attached to worldly people and objects.  So whatever positive gains they accomplish through sādhanā become tarnished by worldly attachment.  If you apply soap on a cloth to cleanse it, but simultaneously keep throwing dirt upon it, your effort will be an exercise in futility.  Hence, Shree Krishna says that it not just devotion, but exclusive devotion to Him that makes Him easily attainable.

मामुपेत्य पुनर्जन्म दु:खालयमशाश्वतम् |

mām upetya punar janma duḥkhālayam aśhāśhvatam
nāpnuvanti mahātmānaḥ sansiddhiṁ paramāṁ gatāḥ

mām—Me; upetya—having attained; punaḥ—again; janma—birth; duḥkha-ālayam—place full of miseries; aśhāśhvatam—temporary; na—never; āpnuvanti—attain; mahā-ātmānaḥ—the great souls; sansiddhim—perfection; paramām—highest; gatāḥ—having achieved
Translation
BG 8.15: Having attained Me, the great souls are no more subject to rebirth in this world, which is transient and full of misery, because they have attained the highest perfection.

Commentary
What is the result of attaining God?  Those who become God-realized get released from the cycle of life and death, and reach the divine abode of God.  Thus, they do not have to take birth again in this material world, which is a place of suffering.  We suffer the painful process of birth, crying helplessly.  Then as babies, we have needs that we can’t express, and so we cry.  In adolescence we have to grapple with bodily desires that make us suffer mental anguish.  In married life, we endure the idiosyncrasies of the spouse.  When we reach old age, we suffer from bodily infirmities.  All through life, we suffer the miseries from our own body and mind, the behavior of others, and inclement environment.  Finally, we suffer the pain of death. 

All this misery is not meaningless; it also has a purpose in the grand design of God.  It gives us the realization that the material realm is not our permanent home.  It is like the reformatory for souls like us who have turned their backs toward God.  If we did not suffer misery here, we would never develop the desire for God.  For example, if we put our hand in the fire, two things happen—the skin starts getting burnt, and the neurons create a sensation of pain in the brain.  The burning of the skin is a bad thing, but the sensation of pain is a good thing.  If we did not experience the pain, we would not extract our hand from the fire, and it would suffer extensive damage.  The pain is thus an indication that something is wrong, which needs to be corrected.  Similarly, the pain we experience in the material realm is God’s signal that our consciousness is defective and we need to progress from material consciousness toward union with God. 

Ultimately, we get whatever we have made ourselves worthy of through our chosen efforts.  Those who remain with their consciousness turned around from God continue rotating in the wheel of birth and death; and those who achieve exclusive devotion to God attain His divine Abode.

Translation
BG 8.16: In all the worlds of this material creation, up to the highest abode of Brahma, you will be subject to rebirth, O Arjun. But on attaining My Abode, O son of Kunti, there is no further rebirth.

Commentary
The Vedic scriptures describe seven planes of existence lower than the earthly plane—tal, atal, vital, sutal, talātal, rasātal, pātāl.  These are called narak, or the hellish abodes.  There are also seven planes of existence starting from the earthly plane and above—bhūḥ, bhuvaḥ, swaḥ, mahaḥ, janaḥ, tapaḥ, satyaḥ.  The ones above are called swarg, or celestial abodes.  Other religious traditions also refer to the seven heavens.  In Judaism, seven heavens are named in the Talmud, with Araboth named as the highest (see also Psalm 68.4).  In Islam also, there is mention of seven heavens with the sātvāñ āsmān (seventh sky) enumerated as the highest.

The different planes of existence are called the various worlds.  There are fourteen worlds in our universe. The highest amongst them is the abode of Brahma, called Brahma Lok.  All of these lokas are within the realm of Maya, and the residents of these lokas are subject to the cycle of birth and death.  Shree Krishna has referred to them in the previous verse as duḥkhālayam and aśhāśhvatam (impermanent and full of misery). 

Even Indra, the king of the celestial gods, has to die one day.  The Puranas relate that once Indra engaged Vishwakarma, the celestial architect, in the construction of a huge palace.  Wearied by its construction, which was not ending, Vishwakarma prayed to God for help.  God came there, and He asked Indra, “Such a huge palace!  How many Vishwakarmas have been engaged in its making?”  Indra was surprised by the question, and replied, “I thought there was only one Vishwakarma.”  God smiled and said, “Like this universe with fourteen worlds, there are unlimited universes.  Each has one Indra and one Vishwakarma.” 

Then Indra saw lines of ants walking toward him.  He was surprised and asked from where so many ants were coming.  God said, “I have brought all those souls here who were Indra once in their past lives, and are now in the bodies of ants.”  Indra was astonished by their vast number.

Shortly after, Lomesh Rishi came to the scene.  He was carrying a straw mat on his head; on his chest was a circle of hair.  Some hair had fallen from the circle, creating gaps.  Indra received the sage, and politely queried from him, “Sir, why do you carry a straw mattress on your head.  And what is the meaning of the hair circle on your chest?” 

Lomesh Rishi replied, “I have received the boon of chirāyu (long life).  At the end of one Indra’s tenure in this universe, one hair falls of.  That explains the gaps in the circle.  My disciples wish to build a house for me to stay in, but I think that life is temporary, so why build a residence here?  I keep this straw mat, which protects me from rain and the sun.  At night, I spread it on the ground and go to sleep.”  Indra was astonished, thinking, “This ṛiṣhi has the lifespan of many Indras, and yet he says that life is temporary.  Then why am I building such a big palace?”  His pride was squashed and he let Vishwakarma go.

While reading these stories, we also must not fail to marvel at the amazing insight of the Bhagavad Gita regarding the cosmology of the universe.  As late as in the sixteenth century, Nicholas Copernicus was the first western scientist to propose a proper heliocentric theory stating that the sun was in fact the center of the universe.  Until then, the entire Western world believed that the earth was the center of the universe.  Subsequent advancement in astronomy revealed that the sun was also not the center of the universe, but revolving around the epicenter of a galaxy called the Milky Way.  Further progress enabled scientists to conclude that there are many galaxies like the Milky Way, each of them having innumerable stars, like our Sun. 

In contrast, Vedic philosophy states five thousand years ago that the earth is Bhūr Lok, which is revolving around Swar Lok, and between them is the realm called Bhuvar Lok.  But Swar Lok is also not stationary either; it is fixed in the gravitation of Jana Lok, and between them is the realm called Mahar Lok.  But Jana Lok is not stationary either; it is revolving around Brahma Lok (Satya Lok), and between them is the realm called Tapa Lok.  This explains the seven higher worlds; similarly, there are seven lower worlds.   Now, for an insight given five thousand years ago, this is most amazing!

Shree Krishna says in this verse that all the fourteen worlds in the universe are within the realm of Maya, and hence their residents are subject to the cycle of birth and death.  However, those who attain God-realization are released from the bondage of the material energy.  Upon leaving this material body at death, they attain the divine abode of God.  There, they receive divine bodies in which they eternally participate in the divine Pastimes of God.  Thus, they do not have to take birth in this material world again.  Some saints do come back even after liberation from Maya.  But they do so only to help others get out of bondage as well.  These are the great descended Masters and great Prophets, who engage in the divine welfare of humankind.

sahasra—one thousand; yuga—age; paryantam—until; ahaḥ—one day; yat—which; brahmaṇaḥ—of Brahma; viduḥ—know; rātrim—night; yuga-sahasra-antām—lasts one thousand yugas; te—they; ahaḥ-rātra-vidaḥ—those who know his day and night; janāḥ—people
Translation
BG 8.17: One day of Brahma (kalp) lasts a thousand cycles of the four ages (mahā yug) and his night also extends for the same span of time. The wise who know this understand the reality about day and night.

Commentary
The measurements of time in the Vedic cosmological system are also vast and staggering.  For example, there are insects that are born in the night; they grow up, procreate, lay eggs, and grow old, all in one night.  In the morning, you see them all dead under the street lights.  If these insects were told that their entire lifespan was only one night of human beings, they would find it incredulous. 

Similarly, the Vedas state that one day and night of the celestial gods, such as Indra and Varun, corresponds to one year on the earth plane.  One year of the celestial gods, consisting of 30 × 12 days is equal to 360 years on the earth plane.  12,000 years of the celestial gods correspond to one mahā yug (cycle of four yugas) on the earth plane, i.e. 4 million and 320 thousand years.

1,000 such mahā yugas comprise one day of Brahma.  This is called kalp and is the largest unit of time in the world.  Equal to that is Brahma’s night.  By these calculations, Brahma lives for 100 years.  By earth calculations, it is 311 trillion 40 billion years. 

Thus, the Vedic calculations of time are as follows:

Kali Yug: 432,000 years.

Dwāpar Yug: 864,000 years.

Tretā Yug: 1,296,000 years.

Satya Yug: 1,728,000 years.

Together, they comprise a Mahā Yug: 4,320,000 years.

One thousand Mahā Yugas comprise one day of Brahma, which is a kalp: 4,320,000,000 years.  Of equal duration is Brahma’s night.  Shree Krishna says that those who understand this are the true knowers of day and night.

The entire duration of the universe is equal to Brahma’s lifespan of 100 years: 311 trillion 40 billion years.  Brahma is also a soul, who has attained that position and is discharging his duties for God.  Hence, Brahma is also within the cycle of life and death.  However, being of extremely elevated consciousness, he is assured that at the end of his life, he will be released from the cycle of life and death and go to the Abode of God.  Occasionally, when no soul is eligible to perform the duties of Brahma at the time of the creation of the world, God Himself becomes Brahma.

Translation
BG 8.18: At the advent of Brahma’s day, all living beings emanate from the unmanifest source. And at the fall of his night, all embodied beings again merge into their unmanifest source.

Commentary
In the amazing cosmic play of the universe, the various worlds (planes of existence) and their planetary systems undergo repeated cycles of creation, preservation, and dissolution (sṛiṣhṭi, sthiti, and pralaya).  At the end of Brahma’s day, corresponding to one kalp of 4,320,000,000 years, all the planetary systems up to Mahar Lok are destroyed.  This is called naimittik pralaya (partial dissolution).  In the Shreemad Bhagavatam, Shukadev tells Parikshit that just as a child makes structures with toys during the day and dismantles them before sleeping, similarly, Brahma creates the planetary systems and their life forms when he wakes up and dismantles them before sleeping. 

At the end of Brahma’s life of 100 years, the entire universe is dissolved.  At this time, the entire material creation winds up.  The pañch-mahābhūta merge into the pañch-tanmātrās, the pañch-tanmātrās merge into ahankār, ahankār merges into mahān, and mahān merges into prakṛiti.  Prakṛiti is the subtle form of the material energy, Maya.  Maya, in its primordial state, then goes and sits in the body of the Supreme Lord, Maha Vishnu.  This is called prākṛit pralaya, or mahāpralaya (great dissolution).  Again, when Maha Vishnu wishes to create, He glances at the material energy in the form of prakṛiti, and by His mere glance, it begins unfolding.  From prakṛiti, mahān is created: from mahān, ahankār is created; from ahankār, pañch-tanmātrās are created; from pañch-tanmātrās, pañch-mahābhūta are created.  In this way, unlimited universes are created.

Modern day scientists estimate that there are 100 billion stars in the Milky Way.  Like the Milky Way, there are 1 billion galaxies in the universe.  Thus, by estimation of scientists, there are 10^20 stars in our universe.  According to the Vedas, like our universe, there are innumerable universes, of differing sizes and features.  Every time, Maha Vishnu breathes in, unlimited universes manifest from the pores of His body, and when He breathes out, all the universes dissolve back.  Thus the 100 years of Brahma’s life are equal to one breath of Maha Vishnu.  Each universe has one Brahma, one Vishnu, and one Shankar.  So there are innumerable Brahmas, Vishnus, and Shankars in innumerable universes.  All the Vishnus in all the universes are expansions of Maha Vishnu.

Translation
BG 8.19: The multitudes of beings repeatedly take birth with the advent of Brahma’s day, and are reabsorbed on the arrival of the cosmic night, to manifest again automatically on the advent of the next cosmic day.

Commentary
The Vedas list four pralayas (dissolutions):

Nitya Pralaya:  This is the daily dissolution of our consciousness that takes place when we fall into deep sleep.

Naimittik Pralaya:  This is the dissolution of all the abodes up to Mahar Lok at the end of Brahma’s day.  At that time, the souls residing in these abodes become unmanifest.  They reside in a state of suspended animation in the body of Vishnu.  Again when the Brahma creates these lokas, they are given birth according to their past karmas.

Mahā Pralaya:  This is the dissolution of the entire universe at the end of Brahma’s life.  At this time, all the souls in the universe go into a state of suspended animation in the body of Maha Vishnu.  Their gross (sthūl śharīr) and subtle (sūkṣhma śharīr) bodies dissolve, but the causal body (kāraṇ sharīr) remains.  When the next cycle of creation takes place, they are again given birth, according to their sanskārs and karmas stored in their causal body.

Ātyantik Pralaya:  When the soul finally attains God, it gets released from the cycle of birth and death forever.  Ātyantik Pralaya is the dissolution of the bonds of Maya, which were tying the soul since eternity.

Translation
BG 8.20: Transcendental to this manifest and unmanifest creation, there is yet another unmanifest eternal dimension. That realm does not cease even when all others do.

Commentary
After completing His exposé on the material worlds and their impermanence, Shree Krishna next goes on to talk about the spiritual dimension.  It is beyond the scope of the material energy, and is created by the spiritual Yogmaya energy of God.  It is not destroyed when all the material worlds are destroyed.  Shree Krishna mentions in verse 10.42 that the spiritual dimension is three-fourth of God’s entire creation, while the material dimension is one-fourth.

Translation
BG 8.21: That unmanifest dimension is the supreme goal, and upon reaching it, one never returns to this mortal world. That is My supreme Abode.

Commentary
The divine sky of the spiritual realm is called Paravyom.  It contains the eternal Abodes of the different forms of God, such as Golok (the Abode of Shree Krishna), Saket Lok (the Abode of Shree Ram), Vaikunth Lok (the Abode of Narayan), Shiv Lok (the Abode of Sadashiv), Devi Lok (the Abode of Mother Durga), etc.  In these Lokas, the Supreme Lord resides eternally in His divine forms along with His eternal Associates.  All these forms of God are non-different from each other; they are various forms of the same one God.  Whichever form of God one worships, upon God-realization, one goes to the Abode of that form of God.  Receiving a divine body, the soul then participates in the divine Activities and Pastimes of the Lord for the rest of eternity.

Translation
BG 8.22: The Supreme Divine Personality is greater than all that exists. Although He is all-pervading and all living beings are situated in Him, yet He can be known only through devotion.

Commentary
The same Supreme Lord, who resides in His divine abode in the spiritual sky, is seated in our hearts; He is also all-pervading in every atom of the material world.  God is equally present everywhere; we cannot say that the all-pervading God is twenty-five percent present, while in His personal form He is a hundred percent present.  He is one hundred percent everywhere.  However, that all-pervading presence of God does not benefit us because we have no perception of it.  Sage Shandilya states:

gavāṁ sarpiḥ śharīrasthaṁ na karotyaṅga poṣhaṇam

(Śhāṇḍilya Bhakti Darśhan)

“Milk resides in the body of the cow, but it does not benefit the health of the cow, which is weak and sick.”  The same milk is extracted from the body of the cow and converted into yogurt.  The yogurt is then fed to the cow with a sprinkling of black pepper and it cures the cow.

Similarly, the all-pervading presence of God does not have the intimacy to enrich our devotion.  We need to first worship Him in His divine form and develop the purity of our heart.  Then we attract God’s grace, and by His grace, He imbues our senses, mind, and intellect with His divine Yogmaya energy.  Our senses then become divine and we are able to perceive the Divinity of the Lord, whether in His personal form or in His all-pervading aspect.  Thus, Shree Krishna states that He can be known only through bhakti. 

The need for doing bhakti has been repeatedly emphasized by Shree Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita.  In verse, 6.47, He stated that He considers one who is engaged in devotion to Him to be the highest of all.  Here, He emphatically uses the word ananyayā, which means “by no other path” can God be known.  Chaitanya Mahaprabhu puts this very nicely:

bhakti mukh nirīkṣhata karm yog jñāna   (Chaitanya Charitāmṛit, Madhya 22.17)

“Although karm, jñāna, and aṣhṭāṅg yog are also pathways to God-realization, all these require the support of bhakti for their fulfillment.”  Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj says the same thing:

karm yog aru jñāna saba, sādhana yadapi bakhān

pai binu bhakti sabai janu, mṛitaka deha binu prān   (Bhakti Śhatak verse 8)

“Although karm, jñāna, and aṣhṭāṅg yog are paths to God-realization, without blending bhakti in them, they all become like dead bodies without life-airs.”  The various scriptures also declare:

bhaktyāhamekayā grāhyaḥ śhraddhayātmā priyaḥ satām  (Bhagavatam 11.14.21)

“I am only attained by My devotees who worship Me with faith and love.”

milahiṅ na raghupati binu anurāgā, kieṅ joga tapa gyāna birāgā   (Ramayan)

“One may practice aṣhṭāṅg-yog, engage in austerities, accumulate knowledge, and develop detachment.  Yet, without devotion, one will never attain God.”

Translation
BG 8.23-26: I shall now describe to you the different paths of passing away from this world, O best of the Bharatas, one of which leads to liberation and the other leads to rebirth. Those who know the Supreme Brahman, and who depart from this world, during the six months of the sun’s northern course, the bright fortnight of the moon, and the bright part of the day, attain the supreme destination. The practitioners of Vedic rituals, who pass away during the six months of the sun’s southern course, the dark fortnight of the moon, the time of smoke, the night, attain the celestial abodes. After enjoying celestial pleasures, they again return to the earth. These two, bright and dark paths, always exist in this world. The way of light leads to liberation and the way of darkness leads to rebirth.

Commentary
Shree Krishna’s statement in these verses still pertains to the question Arjun asked in verse 8.2, “How can we be united with You at the time of death?”  Shree Krishna says that there are two paths—the path of light and the path of darkness.  Here, in these somewhat cryptic statements, we may discern a wonderful allegory for expressing spiritual concepts around the themes of light and darkness. 

The six months of the northern solstice, the bright fortnight of the moon, the bright part of the day, are all characterized by light.  Light is symbolic for knowledge, while darkness is symbolic for ignorance.  The six months of the southern solstice, the dark fortnight of the moon, the night, all these have the commonality of darkness.   Those, whose consciousness is established in God and detached from sensual pursuits, depart by the path of light (discrimination and knowledge).  Being situated in God-consciousness, they attain the Supreme Abode of God, and are released from the wheel of samsara.  But those, whose consciousness is attached to the world, depart by the path of darkness (ignorance).  Being entangled in the bodily concept of life and the illusion of separation from God, they continue rotating in the cycle of life and death.  If they had performed Vedic ritualistic activities, they are temporarily promoted to the celestial abodes, and then have to return to the earth planet.  In this way, all human beings have to take one of the two paths after death.  It now depends upon them, according to their karmas, whether they pass along the bright path or the dark path.

Translation
BG 8.27: Yogis who know the secret of these two paths, O Parth, are never bewildered. Therefore, at all times be situated in Yog (union with God).

Commentary
Yogis are aspirants who are striving to unite their minds with God.  Knowing themselves to be tiny fragments of God, and the futility of a lascivious life, they attach importance to the enhancement of their love for God, rather than the temporary perceptions of sense pleasures.  Thus, they are the followers of the path of light.  Persons who are deluded by the Maya, thinking of this temporary world as permanent, of their body as the self, and of the miseries of the world as sources of pleasure, follow the path of darkness.  The results of both paths are diametrically opposite, one leading to eternal beatitude and the other leading to the continued misery of material existence.  Shree Krishna urges Arjun to discriminate between these paths, and become a yogi, thereby following the path of light. 

He adds a phrase there, “at all times,” which is very important.  Many of us follow the path of light for some time, but then regress to the path of darkness.  If someone wishes to go northward, but keeps going four miles south for every mile north, then that person will end up being south of the starting point, despite endeavoring greatly.  Similarly, following the path of light for some time in the day does not ensure our progress.  We must constantly move ahead in the right direction and stop moving in the wrong direction, only then will we go forward.  Hence, Shree Krishna says, “Be a yogi at all times.”

Translation
BG 8.28: The yogis, who know this secret, gain merit far beyond the fruits of Vedic rituals, the study of the Vedas, performance of sacrifices, austerities, and charities. Such yogis reach the Supreme Abode.

Commentary
We may perform Vedic sacrifices, accumulate knowledge, perform austerities, and donate in charity, but unless we engage in devotion to God, we are still not on the path of light.  All these mundane good deeds result in material rewards, while devotion to God results in liberation from material bondage.  Thus, the Ramayan states:

nema dharma āchāra tapa gyāna jagya japa dāna,

bheṣhaja puni koṭinha nahiṅ roga jāhiṅ harijāna.

“You may engage in good conduct, righteousness, austerities, sacrifices, aṣhṭāṅg-yog, chanting of mantras, and charity.  But without devotion to God, the mind’s disease of material consciousness will not cease.”

The yogis who follow the path of light detach their mind from the world and attach it to God, thereby gaining eternal welfare.  Thus, Shree Krishna says they reap fruits beyond those bestowed by all other processes.

śhrī bhagavān uvācha
idaṁ tu te guhyatamaṁ pravakṣhyāmyanasūyave
jñānaṁ vijñāna-sahitaṁ yaj jñātvā mokṣhyase ’śhubhāt

śhrī-bhagavān uvācha—the Supreme Lord said; idam—this; tu—but; te—to you; guhya-tamam—the most confidential; pravakṣhyāmi—I shall impart; anasūyave—nonenvious; jñānam—knowledge; vijñāna—realized knowledge; sahitam—with; yat—which; jñātvā—knowing; mokṣhyase—you will be released; aśhubhāt—miseries of material existence
Translation
BG 9.1: The Supreme Lord said: O Arjun, because you are not envious of Me, I shall now impart to you this very confidential knowledge and wisdom, upon knowing which you will be released from the miseries of material existence.

Commentary
At the very beginning of the topic, Shree Krishna declares the qualification for hearing these teachings.  Anasūyave means “non-envious.”  He tells Arjun that He is revealing this knowledge because Arjun is non-envious of Him.  Lord Krishna clarifies this because God is going to glorify Himself profusely here.  Anasūyave also has the sense of “one who does not scorn.”  Those listeners who deride Shree Krishna because they believe He is boasting will not benefit from hearing such a message.  Rather, they will incur harm, by thinking, “Look at this egotistic person.  He is praising His own Self.”  

Such an attitude is born of arrogance and pride and it robs a person of devotional reverence.  Envious people cannot grasp the simple fact that God has no need for anything, and therefore everything He does is for the welfare of the souls.  He only praises Himself to enhance devotion in the souls, and not because He has the material defect of conceit as we do.  When Jesus of Nazareth said, “I am the path and the way,” he was saying it motivated by compassion for the souls listening to him, and not out of vanity.  As a true Guru, he was telling his disciples that the path to God is through the Guru.  But the envious-minded do not understand the compassion behind these statements and attribute them to self-conceit.  Since Arjun is magnanimous and free from the defect of envy, he is eminently qualified for the profound knowledge that Shree Krishna is going to reveal in this chapter. 

In the second chapter, Shree Krishna explained the knowledge of the ātmā (soul) as a separate and distinct entity from the body.   That is guhya, or secret knowledge.  In the seventh and eighth chapters, He explained knowledge of His powers, which is guhyatar, or more secret.  And in the ninth and subsequent chapters, He will reveal knowledge of His pure bhakti, which is guhyatam, or the most secret.

rāja-vidyā rāja-guhyaṁ pavitram idam uttamam
pratyakṣhāvagamaṁ dharmyaṁ su-sukhaṁ kartum avyayam

rāja-vidyā—the king of sciences; rāja-guhyam—the most profound secret; pavitram—pure; idam—this; uttamam—highest; pratyakṣha—directly perceptible; avagamam—directly realizable; dharmyam—virtuous; su-sukham—easy; kartum—to practice; avyayam—everlasting
Translation
BG 9.2: This knowledge is the king of sciences and the most profound of all secrets. It purifies those who hear it. It is directly realizable, in accordance with dharma, easy to practice, and everlasting in effect.

Commentary
Rāja means “king.”  Shree Krishna uses the metaphor rāja to emphasize the paramount position of the knowledge He is going to reveal. 

Vidyā means “science.”  He does not refer to His teachings as creed, religion, dogma, doctrine, or belief.  He declares that what He is going to describe to Arjun is the king of sciences. 

Guhya means “secret.”  This knowledge is also the supreme secret.  Since love is only possible where there is a choice, God deliberately hides Himself from direct perception, thereby providing the soul the freedom to exercise the choice of loving Him or not.  A machine cannot love, for it is devoid of choices.  God wants us to love Him and so He gives us the option to choose Him or not, as we wish.  He merely makes us aware of the consequences of what we choose, either way, and then leaves it to us to decide the path we wish to follow.

Pavitram means “pure.”  Knowledge of devotion is supremely pure because it is untainted by petty selfishness.  It inspires sacrifice of the self at the altar of divine love for the Supreme Lord.  Bhakti also purifies the devotee by destroying pāp, bīja, and avidyā.  Pāp is the stockpile of past sins of endless lifetimes of the individual soul.  Bhakti burns them up as a fire burns up a bundle of straw.  Bīja refers to impurities of the heart, which are the seeds of sinful activities.  If the seeds exist, then destroying the results of past sins will not suffice, for the propensity to sin will remain in the heart and one will sin again.  Bhakti purifies the heart and destroys the seeds of sin, which are lust, anger, and greed.  However, even the destruction of the seeds is not enough.  The reason why the heart becomes impure is that there is avidyā (ignorance), because of which we identify with the body.  Because of this misidentification, we think of the body as the self, and hence create bodily desires thinking they will give happiness to the self.  Fulfillment of such material desires further leads to lust, anger, greed, and all the other impurities of the heart.  As long as the ignorance remains, even if the heart is cleansed, it will again become impure.  Devotion ultimately results in realized knowledge of the soul and God, which in turn destroys the ignorance of material existence.  The benefits of bhakti are described in the Bhakti Rasāmṛit Sindhu as follows:  kleśhas tu pāpaṁ tadbījam avidyā cheti te tridhā  (1.1.18)  “Bhakti destroys the three poisons—pāp (sins), bīja (the seed of sins), avidyā (the ignorance in the heart).”  Only when the three are completely destroyed, does the heart become truly and permanently pure. 

Pratyakṣha means “directly perceptible.”  The practice of the science of bhakti begins with a leap of faith and results in direct perception of God.  It is not unlike the methodology of other sciences, where we begin an experiment with a hypothesis and conclude with a verified result. 

Dharmyam means “virtuous.”  Devotion performed without desire for material rewards is the most virtuous action.  It is continuously nourished by righteous acts such as service to the Guru. 

Kartum susukham means “very easy to practice.”  God does not need anything from us; He is attained very naturally if we can learn to love Him. 

When this is the sovereign science and it is easy to practice, then why do people not apply themselves to learning it?  Shree Krishna explains this next.

aśhraddadhānāḥ—people without faith; puruṣhāḥ—(such) persons; dharmasya—of dharma; asya—this; parantapa—Arjun, conqueror the enemies; aprāpya—without attaining; mām—Me; nivartante—come back; mṛityu—death; samsāra—material existence; vartmani—in the path
Translation
BG 9.3: People who have no faith in this dharma are unable to attain Me, O conqueror of enemies. They repeatedly come back to this world in the cycle of birth and death.

Commentary
In the last two verses, Shree Krishna promised knowledge and then qualified it with eight merits.  It is mentioned here as “this dharma,” or the path of loving devotion to God. 

No matter how wonderful the knowledge and how effective the path, it remains useless to one who refuses to walk on it.  As explained in the previous verse, direct perception of God comes later; initially, a leap of faith is required to begin the process.  The Bhakti Rasāmṛit Sindhu (1.4.15) states:  ādau śhraddhā tataḥ sādhusaṅgo ’tha bhajanakriyā  “The first step in the path to God-realization is to have faith.  Then one begins participating in satsaṅg (spiritual programs).  This leads to the personal practice of devotion.” 

Often people say that they are only willing to believe in what they can directly perceive, and since there is no immediate perception of God, they do not believe in Him.  However, the fact is that we believe in so many things in the world too, without direct perception of them.  A judge delivers judgment upon a case concerning an event that took place many years in the past.  If the judge adopted the philosophy of believing only what he or she had directly experienced, then the entire legal system would fail.  A President administers a country on the basis of reports from all over the country.  It is impossible for him to visit and see all the villages and cities within his domain.  Now, if he was not willing to believe these reports, on the grounds that he had no direct perception of what was happening, how would he be able to administer the whole country?  So, even in material activities, faith is required at every step.  The Bible states this very nicely:  “We walk by faith, and not by sight.” (2 Corinthians 5:7) 

There is a beautiful story regarding perception of God.  A king once accosted a sadhu with the statement, “I do not believe in God because I cannot see Him.”  The sadhu asked for a cow to be brought to king’s court.  The king obliged and ordered his servants to bring a cow.  The sadhu then requested that it be milked.  The king again instructed his servants to do as the sadhu wanted.  The sadhu asked, “O King!  Do you believe that this milk, freshly taken out from the cow, contains butter?”  The king said he had full faith that it did.  The sadhu said, “You cannot see the butter in the milk.  Then why do you believe it is there?”  The king replied, “We cannot see it at present because the butter is pervading the milk, but there is a process for seeing it.  If we convert the milk into yogurt, and then churn the yogurt, the butter will become visible.”  The sadhu said, “Like the butter in the milk, God is everywhere.  If we cannot immediately perceive Him, we should not jump to the conclusion that there is no God.  There is a process for perceiving Him; if we are willing to have faith and follow the process, we will then get direct perception of God and become God-realized.”

Belief in God is not a natural process that we as human beings just follow.  We have to exercise our free will and actively make a decision to have faith in God.  In the assembly of the Kauravas, when Dushasan endeavored to disrobe Draupadi, Lord Krishna saved her from shame and embarrassment by lengthening her sari.  All the Kauravas present saw this miracle, but refused to have faith in the omnipotence of Shree Krishna and come to their senses.  The Supreme Lord says in this verse that those who choose not to have faith in the spiritual path remain bereft of divine wisdom and continue rotating in the cycle of life and death.

mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ jagad avyakta-mūrtinā

mayā—by Me; tatam—pervaded; idam—this; sarvam—entire; jagat—cosmic manifestation; avyakta-mūrtinā—the unmanifested form; mat-sthāni—in Me; sarva-bhūtāni—all living beings; na—not; cha—and; aham—I; teṣhu—in them; avasthitaḥ—dwell
Translation
BG 9.4: This entire cosmic manifestation is pervaded by Me in My unmanifest form. All living beings dwell in Me, but I do not dwell in them.

Commentary
The Vedic philosophy does not accept the concept of God creating the world and then peeping into it from the seventh heaven to check whether His world is running all right.  They repeatedly propound the theme of God being all-pervading in the world:

eko devaḥ sarvabhūteṣhu gūḍhaḥ sarvavyāpī   (Śhwetāśhvatar Upaniṣhad 6.11)

“There is one God; He is seated in everyone’s heart; He is also everywhere in the world.” 

īśhāvāsyam idam sarvaṁ yat kiñcha jagatyāṁ jagat   (Īśhopaniṣhad 1)

“God is everywhere in the world.”

puruṣha evedaṁ sarvaṁ, yad bhūtaṁ yachcha bhavyam   (Puruṣh Sūktam)

“God pervades everything that has existed and all that will exist.”

This concept of God being everywhere is understood subjectively.  Some Eastern philosophers claim that the world is a pariṇām (transformation) of God.  For example, milk is an unadulterated substance.  In contact with acid, it transforms to yogurt.  Thus, yogurt is a pariṇām (effect or product) of milk, when it is transformed.  Similarly, the protagonists of pariṇām vāda state that God has transformed into the world. 

Other philosophers claim that the world is vivarta (to mistake one object for another).  For example, in the darkness a rope may be mistaken for a snake.  In the moonlight, a shining oyster may be mistaken for silver.  Similarly, they say that there is only God and no world; what we are seeing as the world is actually Brahman. 

However, according to verses 7.4 and 7.5, the world is neither pariṇām nor vivarta.  It is created from the material energy of God, called Maya śhakti.  The souls too are the energy of God, but they are His superior energy, called Jīva śhakti.  Therefore, the world and all the souls in it are both God’s energies and are within His personality.  However, Shree Krishna also says that He does not dwell in the living beings, i.e. the infinite is not contained by the finite beings.  That is because He is far more than the sum total of these two energies.  Just as an ocean throws up many waves, and these waves are a part of the ocean, but the ocean is much more than the sum total of the waves,  similarly too, the souls and Maya exist within the personality of God, yet He is beyond them.

na cha mat-sthāni bhūtāni paśhya me yogam aiśhwaram
bhūta-bhṛin na cha bhūta-stho mamātmā bhūta-bhāvanaḥ

na—never; cha—and; mat-sthāni—abide in Me; bhūtāni—all living beings; paśhya—behold; me—My; yogam aiśhwaram—divine energy; bhūta-bhṛit—the sustainer of all living beings; na—never; cha—yet; bhūta-sthaḥ—dwelling in; mama—My; ātmā—Self; bhūta-bhāvanaḥ—the Creator of all beings
Translation
BG 9.5: And yet, the living beings do not abide in Me. Behold the mystery of My divine energy! Although I am the Creator and Sustainer of all living beings, I am not influenced by them or by material nature.

Commentary
Beyond the two energies mentioned in the purport to the previous verse—Maya śhakti and Jīva śhakti—there is a third energy of God.  This is called Yogmaya śhakti, which He refers to in this verse, as divine energy.  Yogmaya is God’s all-powerful energy.  It is called kartum-akartum-samarthaḥ, or “that which can make the impossible possible,” and is responsible for many of the amazing things we attribute to His personality.  For example, God is seated in our hearts, yet we have no perception of Him.  This is because His divine Yogmaya power keeps us aloof from Him. 

Similarly, God also keeps Himself aloof from the influence of Maya.  In the Bhagavatam, the Vedas praise the Lord:

vilajjamānayā yasya sthātumīkṣhā-pathe ’muyā   (2.5.13)

“Maya feels embarrassed to even stand before God.”  Isn’t it a wonder that although God pervades Maya, the material energy, yet He is aloof from it?  This is again by the mysterious power of Yogmaya.

If the world could influence God, then when it decays or is destroyed, His nature and personality will also deteriorate.  But despite all modifications in the world, God remains established in His personality.  Accordingly, the Vedas call God by the name Daśhāṅgulī, or “ten fingers.”  He is in the world, and yet ten fingers beyond it—untouched by it.

Translation
BG 9.6: Know that as the mighty wind blowing everywhere rests always in the sky, likewise all living beings rest always in Me.

Commentary
Shree Krishna has used the term mat sthāni three times, from the fourth verse to the sixth verse.  It means “all living beings rest in Him.”  They cannot be separated from Him even though they transmigrate in different bodies and accept affinity with matter. 

It may be a little difficult to conceive how the world rests in God.  Greek mythology shows a picture of Atlas holding up the globe.  In Greek folklore, Atlas fought with the Titans in the war against the deities of Mount Olympus.  As punishment, he was condemned to forever bear the earth and the heavens on his back with the great pillar that supposedly separates them on his shoulders.  This is not what Shree Krishna means when He says that He is upholding all beings.  The entire cosmos exists in space and space is created by God’s energy.  Thus, all beings can be said to be resting in Him.  

The Supreme Lord now gives an analogy to enable Arjun to grasp the concept.  The wind has no existence independent from the sky.  It moves incessantly and furiously, and yet, it rests within the sky.  Likewise, the souls have no existence independent of God.  They move in time, place, and consciousness, through transitory bodies, sometimes rapidly and sometimes slowly, and yet, they always exist within God. 

From another perspective, everything that exists in cosmos is subordinate to the will of God.  It is created, maintained, and annihilated in accordance with His will.  In this way also, everything can be said to be resting in Him.

Translation
BG 9.7-8: At the end of one kalp, all living beings merge into My primordial material energy. At the beginning of the next creation, O son of Kunti, I manifest them again. Presiding over My material energy, I generate these myriad forms again and again, in accordance with the force of their natures.

Commentary
Shree Krishna explained in the last two verses that all living beings dwell in Him.  This statement may bring up the following question: “When mahāpralaya (the great annihilation) takes place and the entire world is wound up, then where do all the living beings go?”  The answer to this question is being given in this verse. 

In the previous chapter, verses 8.16 to 8.19, Shree Krishna explained how creation, maintenance, and annihilation follow a repetitive cycle.  Here, the word kalpa-kṣhaya means “the end of Brahma’s lifespan.”  On the completion of Brahma’s life of 100 years, which is equal to 311 trillion 40 billion earth years, the entire cosmic manifestation dissolves and goes into an unmanifest state.  The pañch mahābhūta merge into the pañch tanmātrās; the pañch tanmātrās merge into ahankār; ahankār merges into mahān; mahān merges into prakṛiti, the primordial form of the material energy; and prakṛiti goes and rests in the divine body of the Supreme Lord, Maha Vishnu.

At that time, all the souls within the material creation also go and rest in the body of God, in a state of suspended animation.  Their gross and subtle bodies merge back into the source, Maya.  However, the causal body still remains.  (The three kinds of bodies have been described in detail in the commentary to verse 2.28)  After dissolution, when God creates the world again, the material energy unwinds in the reverse sequence prakṛiti—mahān—ahankār—pañch tanmātrā—pañch mahābhūta.  Then, the souls that were lying in a state of suspended animation with only causal bodies are again placed in the world.  In accordance with their causal bodies, they again receive subtle and gross bodies, and the various life forms are created in the universe.  These life forms vary in nature amongst the different planes of existence.  In some planetary systems, fire is the dominant element in the body, just as in the earth plane, the dominant bodily elements are earth and water.  Hence, the bodies vary in their subtleness and the functions they can perform.  Shree Krishna thus calls them myriad life forms.

Translation
BG 9.9: O conqueror of wealth, none of these actions bind Me. I remain like a neutral observer, ever detached from these actions.

Commentary
The material energy is actually inert and insentient.  It is devoid of consciousness, which is the source of life.  How then, one may wonder, does it perform the wonderful work of creating such an amazing world?  The Ramayan explains this well:

jāsu satyatā teṅ jaṛa māyā, bhāsa satya iva moha sahāyā.

“The material energy is insentient by itself.  But when it receives inspiration from God, it begins to act as if it were sentient.”  This is like a pair of tongs in the kitchen.  They are lifeless by themselves.  But in the hands of a chef they come to life and do wonderful things such as lifting red-hot bowls.  Likewise, by itself, the material energy does not have the power to do anything.  When God wishes to create the world, He glances at the material energy and animates it.  The main idea to keep in mind is that although the process of creation goes on by His will and inspiration of God, He remains unaffected by the work of the material energy.  He remains ever-blissful and undisturbed in His personality, by virtue of His hlāndinī śhakti (bliss-giving power).  Hence, the Vedas call Him ātmārām, meaning “He who rejoices in Himself, without any need for external pleasures.”  Having explained that He is unaffected, God now explains that He is the non-doer and the Supervisor.

Translation
BG 9.10: Working under My direction, this material energy brings into being all animate and inanimate forms, O son of Kunti. For this reason, the material world undergoes the changes (of creation, maintenance, and dissolution).

Commentary
As explained in the last verse, God does not directly engage in the work of creating life forms.  His various energies and souls appointed by Him for the purpose do it under His dominion.  For example, the President of a country does not personally do every task of the government.  He has various departments under Him, and officials appointed for performing the different functions.  And yet, the accomplishments and failures of the government are attributed to Him.  This is because He sanctions the government officials for performing tasks under His jurisdiction.  Similarly, the first-born Brahma and the material energy accomplish the tasks of creation and manifestation of life forms.  Since they work under God’s sanction, He is also referred to as the Creator.

Translation
BG 9.11: When I descend in My personal form deluded persons are unable to recognize Me. They do not know the divinity of My personality, as the Supreme Lord of all beings.

Commentary
Good teachers occasionally use strong words to jostle their students out of the complacence of shallow thinking, into a deeper state of thoughtfulness.  Here, Shree Krishna uses the word mūḍha, which means “dim-witted,” to describe those who deny the divinity of His personal form.

Those who say that God is only formless and cannot manifest in a personal form, contradict the definition of God as being all-mighty and all-powerful.  The Supreme Lord has created this entire world full of forms, shapes, and colors.  If He can do such an amazing feat of creating myriad forms in the world, can He not create a form for Himself?  Or is it that God says, “I do not have the power to manifest in a personal form, and hence I am only formless light.”  To say that He cannot possess a personal form makes Him incomplete. 

We tiny souls also possess forms.  If one holds that God cannot possess a form, then the corollary is that He has even less power than us a human beings.  For God to be perfect and complete, He must have both attributes to His personality—a personal aspect and a formless aspect.  The Vedic scriptures state:

apaśhyaṁ gopāṁ anipadyamānamā   (Ṛig Veda 1.22.164 sūkta 31)

“I had the vision of God as a boy who is never annihilated, and who appeared in a family of cowherds.”

dwibhūjaṁ mauna mudrāḍhyaṁ vana mālinamīśhwaram

(Gopāl Tāpani Upaniṣhad 1.13)

“The Lord, wearing a garland of forest flowers, plays His flute, enchantingly forming the mauna mudrā with His hands.”

gūḍhaṁ paraṁ brahma manuṣhya-liṅgam   (Bhagavatam 7.15.75)

“The deepest knowledge is that God accepts a human-like form.” 

yatrāvatīrṇo bhagavān paramātmā narākṛitiḥ   (Bhagavatam 9.23.20)

“At that time, the Supreme Lord, who possesses all opulences, descended in a human-like form.”

īśhwaraḥ paramaḥ kṛiṣhṇaḥ sachchidānanda vigrahaḥ

anādirādir govindaḥ sarvakāraṇa kāraṇam   (Brahma Samhitā 5.1)

In this verse, Brahma prays to Shree Krishna, “I worship Lord Krishna whose form is eternal, all-knowing, and blissful.  He is without beginning and end, and is the cause of all causes.” 

However, in regard to the personal form of God, we must keep in mind that it is a divine form, which means it is devoid of all the defects found in material forms.  The form of God is sat-chit-ānand—it is eternal, full of knowledge, and constituted of divine bliss. 

asyāpi deva vapuṣho mad-anugrahasya

svechchhā-mayasya na tu bhūta-mayasya ko ’pi   (Bhagavatam 10.14.2)

In this verse, Lord Brahma prays to Shree Krishna, “O Lord, Your body is not made of pañch mahābhūta (the five great elements); it is divine.  And You have descended in this form by Your own free will, to bestow Your grace upon souls like myself.”

In chapter four of the Bhagavad Gita, Shree Krishna stated: “Although I am unborn and imperishable, and the Lord of all living entities, yet I appear in this world, by My Yogmaya power, in My original divine form.” (4.6)  This means that not only does God possess a form, but He also descends in the world as an Avatar. 

Since we souls have been taking births in the world from time immemorial, it is plausible that we were present in the human form on the earth when a previous descension of God was present on the earth.  It is even possible that we saw the descension.  However, the limitation was that God’s form was divine and we possessed material eyes.  So when we saw Him with our eyes, we were unable to recognize the divinity of His personality.  

The divine nature of God’s form is such that His divinity is perceived by each person only to the extent of his or her spiritual power.  When those who are influenced by sattva guṇa see Him, they think, “Shree Krishna is a special person. He is very competent but is definitely not God.”  When those under the spell of rajo guṇa see Him, they say, “There is nothing special in Him.  He is very much like us.”  When those dominated by tamo guṇa see Him, they think, “He is egotistic and characterless, much worse than us.”  It is only the God-realized saints who can recognize Him as God, since they have received divine vision by His grace.  And so, Shree Krishna says that the unaware materially conditioned souls do not know Him when He takes an avatar in the world.

Translation
BG 9.12: Bewildered by the material energy, such persons embrace demoniac and atheistic views. In that deluded state, their hopes for welfare are in vain, their fruitive actions are wasted, and their culture of knowledge is baffled.

Commentary
There are many strands of atheistic views relating to the personal form of God that are prevalent in the world.  Some people declare that God cannot descend in the world in a personal form.  Consequently, they say that Shree Krishna was not God; He was merely a yogi.  Others say that Shree Krishna is Māyā-viśhiṣhṭ brahma, i.e. a lower grade of the Supreme Divinity, due to contact with the material energy.  Yet others say that Shree Krishna was a characterless loafer who roamed around with the cowherd maidens of Vrindavan.

According to this verse, all these theories are incorrect, and the intellects of those who subscribe to them are deluded by the material energy.  Shree Krishna goes to the extent of saying that those who embrace such ungodly philosophies possess demoniac natures.  Since, they do not harbor divine sentiments toward the personal form of the Supreme Lord, they cannot engage in bhakti toward Him.  And since devotion to the formless aspect of God is exceedingly difficult, they cannot do that either.  As a result, they remain bereft of the path to eternal welfare.  Bewildered by the transient attractions of the material energy, their hopes for eternal well-being are in vain.

Translation
BG 9.13: But the great souls, who take shelter of My divine energy, O Parth, know Me, Lord Krishna, as the origin of all creation. They engage in My devotion with their minds fixed exclusively on Me.

Commentary
Shree Krishna’s style of discourse is that He drives the point home by making starkly contrasting comparisons.  After describing the ways of the deluded and confused, He now talks about the great souls.  Material life is a prolonged dream, which is being experienced by the souls who are sleeping under the sway of the material energy.  In contrast, the great souls are those who have woken up from their ignorance and brushed aside material consciousness like a bad dream.  Released from the grips of the material energy, Maya, they are now under the shelter of the divine Yogmaya energy.  Such enlightened souls have woken up to the spiritual reality of their eternal relationship with God. 

Just as God has both aspects to His personality—the formless and the personal form—His Yogmaya energy also possesses both aspects.  It is a formless energy, but it also manifests in the personal form as Radha, Sita, Durga, Lakshmi, Kali, Parvati, etc.  All these divine personalities are manifestations of the divine energy of God, and they are all non-different from each other, just as Krishna, Ram, Shiv, Narayan, etc. are non-different forms of the one God. 

Brahma Vaivarta Purāṇ states:

yathā tvaṁ rādhikā devī goloke gokule tathā

vaikuṇṭhe cha mahālakṣhmī bhavati cha sarasvatī

kapilasya priyā kāntā bhārate bhāratī satī

dwāravatyāṁ mahālakṣhmī bhavatī rukmiṇī satī

tvaṁ sītā mithilāyāṁ cha tvachchhāyā draupadī satī

rāvaṇena hṛitā tvaṁ cha tvaṁ cha rāmasya kāminī

“O Radha, You are the Divine Goddess of Golok (Shree Krishna’s divine Abode) and Gokul (Shree Krishna’s Abode in the material realm, when He descended on earth 5,000 years ago).  You exist in Vaikunth (Lord Vishnu’s Abode) as Mahalakshmi.  You are the consort of Lord Kapil (one of the descensions of God).  You reside in Dwaraka as Rukmini (the wife of Shree Krishna).  You manifested as Sita in the city of Mithila.  The wife of the Pandavas, Draupadi, was like a manifestation of Your shadow.  It was You who was kidnapped by Ravan in the form of Sita, and You are the wife of Lord Ram.”

In this verse, Shree Krishna mentions that great souls take shelter of the divine energy of God.  The reason is that divine grace, knowledge, love, etc. are all God’s divine energies, and are all subservient to the divine Yogmaya energy, which is Radha.  Hence, by the grace of Yogmaya, one receives the love, knowledge, and grace of God.  Great souls, who receive divine grace, become endowed with divine love, and engage in uninterrupted devotion toward God.

Translation
BG 9.14: Always singing My divine glories, striving with great determination, and humbly bowing down before Me, they constantly worship Me in loving devotion.

Commentary
Having said that the great souls engage in His devotion, Shree Krishna now explains how they do bhakti.  He says that devotees become attached to kīrtan as a means of practicing their devotion and enhancing it.  The chanting of the glories of the Lord is called kīrtan, which is defined as:  nāma-līlā-guṇadīnām uchchair-bhāṣhā tu kīrtanam (Bhakti Rasāmṛit Sindhu 1.2.145)  “Singing glories of the Names, Forms, Qualities, Pastimes, Abodes, and Associates of God is called kīrtan.” 

Kīrtan is one of the most powerful means of practicing devotion.  It involves the three-fold devotion of śhravaṇa (hearing), kīrtan (chanting), and smaraṇa (remembering).  The goal is to fix the mind upon God, but it becomes easier when done alongside with hearing and chanting.  As stated in chapter six, the mind is as restless as the wind, and naturally wanders from thought to thought.  Hearing and chanting engage the knowledge senses in the divine realm, which helps in repeatedly bringing back the mind from its wanderings. 

Kīrtan has many other benefits as well.  Often when people practice devotion through japa (chanting of mantra or Name of God on rosary beads) or plain meditation, they find themselves overwhelmed by sleep.  However, kīrtan is such an engaging process that it usually drives sleep away.  Also, chanting blocks out distracting sounds from the environment.  Kīrtan can be practiced in groups which enables mass participation.  In addition, the mind desires variety, which it gets through the medium of kīrtan in the form of the Names, Virtues, Pastimes, Abodes, etc. of God.  And since kīrtan involves loud chanting, the divine vibrations of the Names of God make the entire environment auspicious and holy. 

For all these reasons, kīrtan has been the most popular form of devotion amongst saints in Indian history.  All the famous bhakti Saints—Soordas, Tulsidas, Meerabai, Guru Nanak, Kabir, Tukaram, Ekanath, Narsi Mehta, Jayadev, Tyagaraja, and others—were great poets.  They composed numerous devotional songs, and through them, they engaged in chanting, hearing, and remembering.

The Vedic scriptures particularly extol kīrtan as the simplest and most powerful process of devotion in the present age of Kali. 

kṛite yad dhyāyato viṣhṇuṁ tretāyāṁ yajato makhaiḥ

dwāpare paricharyāyāṁ kalau tad dhari-kīrtanāt   (Bhagavatam 12.3.52)

“The best process of devotion in the age of Satya was simple meditation upon God.  In the age of Tretā, it was the performance of sacrifices for the pleasure of God.  In the age of Dwāpar, worship of the deities was the recommended process.  In the present age of Kali, it is kīrtan alone.”

avikārī vā vikārī vā sarva doṣhaika bhājanaḥ

parameṣha padaṁ yāti rāma nāmānukīrtanāt   (Adhyātma Ramayan)

“Whether you are full of desires or free from them, devoid of defects or full of them, if you engage in kīrtan of the names of Lord Ram, you will attain the highest destination.” 

sarva dharma bahirbhūtaḥ sarva pāparatasthathā

muchyate nātra sandeho viṣhṇornamānukīrtanāt   (Vaiśhampāyan Samhitā)

“Even those who are deeply sinful and bereft of religiosity can be saved by the chanting of the names of Lord Vishnu; of this, there is no doubt.”

kalijuga kevala hari guna gāhā, gāvata nara pāvahiṅ bhava thāhā   (Ramayan)

“In this age of Kali, there is one means of salvation.  By engaging in the chanting of the glories of God, one can cross over this material ocean.” 

However, one must remember that in the process of kīrtan, hearing and chanting are helpers.  The essence is to remember God.  If we leave it out, the kīrtan will not purify the mind.  Thus, Shree Krishna says here that His devotees do kīrtan, while constantly engaging the mind in thinking of Him.  They practice this with great determination for the purification of the mind.

Translation
BG 9.15: Others, engaging in the yajña of cultivating knowledge, worship Me by many methods. Some see Me as undifferentiated oneness that is non-different from them, while others see Me as separate from them. Still others worship Me in the infinite manifestations of My cosmic form.

Commentary
Sādhaks (spiritual practitioners) follow different paths of spirituality to reach the Absolute Truth.  Shree Krishna previously described those who are devotees.  They surrender themselves with devotion at the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, in the attitude of being His eternal parts and servants.  He now describes some of the other paths that sādhaks follow.

Those who follow the path of jñāna-yog consider themselves to be non-different from God.  They contemplate deeply on sūtras such as:  so ’haṁ (I am That), śhivo ’haṁ (I am Shiv), etc.  Their ultimate goal is to attain realization of the Supreme Entity as the undifferentiated Brahman, which possesses the attributes of eternality, knowledge, and bliss, but is devoid of forms, qualities, virtues, and pastimes.  Shree Krishna says that such jñāna yogis also worship Him, but in His formless all-pervading aspect.  In contrast, there are varieties of aṣhṭāṅg yogis etc. who see themselves as distinct from God and relate to Him accordingly.

Still others worship the manifest universe as God.  In Vedic philosophy, this is called viśhwaroop upāsanā (worship of the cosmic form of God).  In western philosophy, it is called “Pantheism” from the Greek words pan (all) and theos (God).  The most famous exponent of this philosophy has been Spinoza.  Since the world is a part of God, keeping a divine sentiment toward it is not wrong, but it is incomplete.  Such devotees do not have knowledge of the other aspects of the Supreme Divine Entity, such as Brahman (God’s undifferentiated all-pervading manifestation), Paramātmā (the Supreme Soul seated in everyone’s hearts), and Bhagavān (the personal form of God). 

How can all these divergent approaches worship the same God?  Shree Krishna answers this in the following verses.

Translation
BG 9.16-17: It is I who am the Vedic ritual, I am the sacrifice, and I am the oblation offered to the ancestors. I am the medicinal herb, and I am the Vedic mantra. I am the clarified butter, I am the fire and the act of offering. Of this universe, I am the Father; I am also the Mother, the Sustainer, and the Grandsire. I am the purifier, the goal of knowledge, the sacred syllable Om. I am the Ṛig Veda, Sāma Veda, and the Yajur Veda.

Commentary
In these verses, Shree Krishna gives a glimpse into the various aspects of His infinite personality.  Kratu means yajña (sacrifice), such as agnihotra yajñas mentioned in the Vedas.  It also refers to the yajñas, such as vaiśhva deva that are described in the Smṛiti scriptures.  Auṣhadham refers to the potency in medicinal herbs.

Creation emanates from God, and hence He is its Pitā (Father).  Before creation, He holds the unmanifested material energy in His womb, and so He is also its Mātā (Mother).  He maintains the universe and nourishes it, and thus He is its Dhātā (Sustainer).  He is also the Father of Brahma, who is the creator, and hence, He is the Grandfather of this universe.

The Vedas have emanated from God.  The Ramayan states:  jākī sahaja svāsa śhruti chārī  “God manifested the Vedas by His breath.”  They are the knowledge potency of God, and hence an aspect of His unlimited personality.  Shree Krishna states this truth dramatically by saying that He is the Vedas.

Translation
BG 9.18: I am the Supreme Goal of all living beings, and I am also their Sustainer, Master, Witness, Abode, Shelter, and Friend. I am the Origin, End, and Resting Place of creation; I am the Storehouse and Eternal Seed.

Commentary
Since the soul is a tiny part of God, its every relationship is with Him.  However, in bodily consciousness, we look upon the relatives of the body as our father, mother, beloved, child, and friend.  We become attached to them and repeatedly bring them to our mind, thereby getting further bound in the material illusion.  But none of these worldly relatives can give us the perfect love that our soul yearns for.  This is for two reasons.  Firstly, these relationships are temporary, and separation is unavoidable when either they or we depart from the world.  Secondly, even as long as they are alive, the attachment is based on selfishness and so it fluctuates in direct proportion to the extent by which self-interest is satisfied.  Thus, the range and intensity of worldly love varies from moment to moment, throughout the day.  “My wife is very nice….she is not so nice…she is ok….she is terrible,” this is the extent of fluctuation of love in the drama of the world.  On the other hand, God is such a relative who has accompanied us lifetime after lifetime.  From birth to birth, in every life-form that we went, God accompanied us and remained seated in our heart.  He is thus our eternal relative.  In addition, He has no self-interest from us; He is perfect and complete in Himself.  He loves us selflessly, for He only desires our eternal welfare.  Thus, God alone is our perfect relative, who is both eternal and selfless.

To understand this concept from another perspective, consider the analogy of an ocean and the waves that emerge from it.  Two neighboring waves in the ocean flow together for some time, and play mirthfully with each other, creating the impression that they have a very deep relationship between them.  However, after travelling some distance, one subsides into the ocean, and shortly after, the other does the same.  Did they have any relationship between themselves?  No, they were both born from the ocean and their relationship was with the ocean itself.  Similarly, God is like the ocean and we are like waves who have emanated from Him.  We create attachments amongst our bodily relations, only to leave everyone upon death, and journey alone into another birth.  The truth is that the souls are not related to each other, but to God, from whom they have all emanated.

In this verse, Shree Krishna takes us above bodily consciousness and its concomitant attachment to worldly relatives.  From the platform of the soul, God alone is all our relationships; He is our Father, Mother, Sister, Brother, Beloved, and Friend.  This theme is reiterated in all the Vedic scriptures:

divyo deva eko nārāyaṇo mātā pitā bhrātā suhṛit gatiḥ 

nivāsaḥ śharaṇaṁ suhṛit gatirnārāyaṇa iti  (Subāl Śhruti, mantra 6)

 “Lord Narayan alone is the Mother, Father, Beloved, and destination of the soul.”

more sabai eka tumha swāmī, dīnabhandhu ura antarajāmī.   (Ramayan)

“O Lord Ram, You alone are my Master, the Savior of the destitute, and the Knower of the heart.”  Knowing the magnitude of our eternal relationship with God, we must endeavor to attach our mind to Him alone.  Then, the mind will be purified and we will be able to fulfill the condition of māmekaṁ śharaṇaṁ vraja, or complete surrender, which is necessary for receiving God’s grace.  To achieve this single-mindedness, we must cut all the present attachments of the mind and replace them with attachment to God.  Hence, the Ramayan states:

saba kai mamatā tāga baṭorī, mama pada manahi bāñdha bari ḍorī.

“Cut all the strings of worldly attachment of your mind; make a rope of these strings, and tie it at the lotus feet of God.”  To help us tie our mind to Him, Shree Krishna here explains to Arjun that the soul’s every relationship is with God alone.

Translation
BG 9.19: I radiate heat as the sun, and I withhold, as well as send forth rain. I am immortality as well as death personified, O Arjun. I am the spirit as well as matter.

Commentary
The Puranas describe that when God first created the universe, He manifested the first-born Brahma and entrusted him with the work of further creation.  Brahma was bewildered by the task of creating the materials and the life-forms in the universe from the subtle material energy.  Then God revealed knowledge unto him, which is called the Chatuḥśhlokī Bhāgavat (the four-versed Bhagavatam), on the basis of which Brahma proceeded to create the world.  Its first verse states very emphatically:

ahamevāsamevāgre nānyadyatsadasat param

paśhchādahaṁ yadetachcha yo ’vaśhiṣhyeta so ’smyaham   (Bhagavatam 2.9.32)

Shree Krishna tells Brahma: “I am all that is.  Prior to creation, I alone existed.  Now that creation has come about, whatever is in the form of the manifested world is my very self.  After dissolution, I alone will exist.  There is nothing apart from Me.”

The above truth implies that the material with which we worship is also God.  When people venerate the holy Ganges, they immerse the lower half of their body in the river.  Then they lift water in their palms and pour it into the Ganges.  In this way, they use the Ganges water itself to worship it.  Similarly, when God is all that exists, then the material for worshipping Him is also non-different from Him.  Thus, as previously stated in verses 16 and 17, Shree Krishna reveals that He is the Vedas, the sacrificial fire, the syllable “Om,” the clarified butter, and the act of offering.  No matter what the form and sentiment of our devotion, there is nothing apart from God that we can offer to Him.  Nevertheless, it is the sentiment of love that pleases God, not the material of the offering.

Translation
BG 9.20: Those who are inclined to the fruitive activity described in the Vedas worship Me through ritualistic sacrifices. Being purified from sin by drinking the Soma juice, which is the remnant of the yajñas, they seek to go to heaven. By virtue of their pious deeds, they go to the abode of Indra, the king of heaven, and enjoy the pleasures of the celestial gods.

Commentary
Previously, in verses 9.11 and 9.12, Shree Krishna described the mentality of the non-believers and the demoniac, who embrace atheistic and ungodly views, and the repercussions that such people face.  Then, He described the nature of great souls, who are engaged in loving devotion to Him.  Now, in this verse and the next, He mentions those who are not devotees, but are not atheistic either. They perform the ritualistic ceremonies of the Vedas.  This science of karm kāṇḍ (Vedic rituals) is referred to as trai-vidyā.

People who are fascinated by the science of trai-vidyā worship the celestial gods, such as Indra, through the performance of yajñas (fire sacrifices) and other rituals.  They worship the Supreme Lord indirectly because they do not realize that it is He alone who sanctions the gifts that the celestial gods bestow.  Ritualistic ceremonies are considered good deeds, but they are not counted as devotion.  The performers of ritualistic ceremonies do not get released from the cycle of life and death.  They go to the higher planes of existence within the material universe, such as abode of Indra, the king of heaven.  There, they enjoy exquisite celestial delights that are thousands of times more pleasurable than the sensual pleasures available on the earth.  In the following verse, Shree Krishna points out the defect in celestial pleasures.

Translation
BG 9.21: When they have enjoyed the vast pleasures of heaven, the stock of their merits being exhausted, they return to the earthly plane. Thus, those who follow the Vedic rituals, desiring objects of enjoyment, repeatedly come and go in this world.

Commentary
Shree Krishna explains in this verse that the celestial delights of the heavenly abodes are temporary.  After people who have been promoted there have fully enjoyed heavenly pleasures and exhausted their merits, they are sent back to the earthly plane.  Thus, attaining promotion to the heavenly abodes does not fulfill the eternal quest of the soul.  We have all been there many times in endless past lifetimes, and yet the hunger of the soul for infinite Bliss has not yet been satiated.  All the Vedic scriptures support this belief:

tāvat pramodate swarge yāvat puṇyaṁ samāpyate

kṣhīṇa puṇyaḥ patatyarvāganichchhan kāla-chālitaḥ   (Bhagavatam 11.10.26)

“Residents of heaven enjoy the celestial delights until their merits have been exhausted.  Then they are reluctantly forced to fall back to the lower abodes by the passage of time.”

swargahu swalpa anta dukhadāī   (Ramayan)

“The attainment of heaven is temporary, and is followed by miseries.” 

Just as a football gets kicked all over the field, Maya is kicking the soul around in forgetfulness of God.  Sometimes it goes to the lower abodes, while sometimes to the higher abodes.  Amongst these multitudes of forms it receives, across the lower and higher abodes, only the human form offers the facility for God-realization.  Hence, the scriptures state that even the celestial gods pray to be given birth as a human being, so that they may rectify their previous mistake of going to heaven, and strive toward God-realization.  

durlabhaṁ mānuṣhaṁ janma prārthayate tridaśhairapi   (Nārad Purāṇ)

“The human form is exceedingly rare.  Even the celestial gods pray to attain it.”  Thus, Lord Ram instructed the residents of Ayodhya:

baṛeñ bhāga mānuṣha tanu pāvā, sura durlabha saba granthanhi gāvā   (Ramayan)

“O people of Ayodhya, you all are extremely fortunate to have been bestowed a human birth, which is exceedingly rare and is desired even by the residents of heaven.”  When the celestial beings long for a human birth, then why should we humans seek promotion to the celestial abodes?  Rather, we should aim for God-realization by engaging in devotion to the Supreme Lord.

ananyāḥ—always; chintayantaḥ—think of; mām—Me; ye—those who; janāḥ—persons; paryupāsate—worship exclusively; teṣhām—of them; nitya abhiyuktānām—who are always absorbed; yoga—supply spiritual assets; kṣhemam—protect spiritual assets; vahāmi—carry; aham—I
Translation
BG 9.22: There are those who always think of Me and engage in exclusive devotion to Me. To them, whose minds are always absorbed in Me, I provide what they lack and preserve what they already possess.

Commentary
A mother never thinks of deserting her newborn helpless child who is entirely dependent upon her.  The supreme and eternal mother of the soul is God.  In this verse, God offers  motherly assurance to souls who surrender exclusively to Him.  The words used are vahāmi aham, meaning “I personally carry the burden of maintaining My devotees,” just as a married man carries the burden of maintaining his wife and children.  God promises two things.  The first is yog—He bestows His devotees the spiritual assets they do not possess.  The second is kṣhem—He protects the spiritual assets that His devotees already possess.

However, the condition He has placed for this is exclusive surrender.  This can again be understood through the same analogy of the mother and child.  A newborn baby is fully dependent upon its mother, who takes care of the baby’s welfare entirely.  The baby simply cries whenever it needs anything; the mother cleans it, feeds it, bathes it, etc.  But when the baby becomes a five-year old child, it begins doing some actions for itself.  To that extent the mother reduces her responsibilities.  And when the same child becomes a youth and assumes all responsibilities, the mother relinquishes her responsibilities further.  Now if the father comes home and asks, “Where is our son?” the mother replies, “He has not returned home after school.  He must have gone for a movie with his friends.”  Her attitude is now more neutral toward him.  But when the same boy was a five-year old, and had gotten delayed by ten minutes in returning home from school, both the mother and father would begin worrying, “What has happened?  He is a small child.  Let’s hope he has not met with an accident.  Let us phone the school and find out.” 

In this way, as the boy keeps assuming more responsibilities, his mother keeps relinquishing her responsibilities.  God’s law is exactly the same.  When we act from our independent will, thinking that we are the doers of our actions, and depend upon our own prowess and abilities, God does not bestow His grace.  He merely notes our karmas and gives the result.  When we surrender partially to Him and partially depend upon material crutches, God also partially bestows His grace upon us.  And when we offer ourselves exclusively to Him, māmekaṁ śharaṇaṁ vraja, God bestows His complete grace and takes full responsibility, by preserving what we have and providing what we lack.

Translation
BG 9.23: O son of Kunti, even those devotees who faithfully worship other gods also worship Me. But they do so by the wrong method.

Commentary
Having described the position of those who worship the Supreme Lord, Shree Krishna now explains the situation of those who worship the lower gods for material gains.  They are also endowed with faith, and they may have their supplications answered by the celestial gods, but their understanding is incomplete.  They do not realize that the celestial beings receive their powers from God Himself.  Hence, they also worship the Supreme Divine Personality, albeit indirectly.  For example, if a government officer redresses a complaint by a citizen, he is not credited with being benevolent.  He is merely utilizing the powers in his jurisdiction that have been bestowed upon him by the government.  Similarly, all the powers of the celestial gods come from the Supreme Lord.  Thus, those with superior understanding do not go by the indirect route; they worship the source of all powers, which is God Himself.  Such worship that is offered to the Supreme Lord automatically satisfies the entire creation:

yathā taror mūla-niṣhechanena

tṛipyanti tatskandhabhujopaśhākhāḥ

prāṇopahārāchcha yathendriyāṇāṁ

tathaiva sarvārhaṇam achyutejyā   (Bhagavatam 4.31.14)

“When we water the root of a tree, its trunk, branches, twigs, leaves, and flowers all become nourished.  When we put food in our mouth, it nourishes the life airs and the senses automatically.  In the same way, by worshipping the Supreme Lord, all His parts, including the devatās are also worshipped.”  However, if we begin watering the leaves of a tree, while neglecting its roots, the tree will perish.  Likewise, the worship offered  to the celestial gods certainly makes its way to the Supreme Lord, but such devotees do not get spiritual benefits.  This is elaborated in the next verse.

Translation
BG 9.24: I am the enjoyer and the only Lord of all sacrifices. But those who fail to realize My divine nature must be reborn.

Commentary
Shree Krishna now explains the drawback in worshipping the celestial gods.  By virtue of the powers bestowed upon them by the Supreme Lord, they do possess the ability to grant material favors, but they cannot liberate their devotees from the cycle of life and death.  They can only offer to others what they themselves possess.  When the celestial gods themselves are not liberated from samsara, then how can they release their devotees from it?  On the other hand, those whose understanding is proper offer their entire veneration at the feet of God Himself, and when their devotion reaches the stage of perfection, they go beyond the world of mortals to the divine Abode.

yānti—go; deva-vratāḥ—worshipers of celestial gods; devān—amongst the celestial gods; pitṝīn—to the ancestors; yānti—go; pitṛi-vratā—worshippers of ancestors; bhūtāni—to the ghosts; yānti—go; bhūta-ijyāḥ—worshippers of ghosts; yānti—go; mat—my; yājinaḥ—devotees; api—and; mām—to Me
Translation
BG 9.25: Worshippers of the celestial gods take birth amongst the celestial gods, worshippers of the ancestors go to the ancestors, worshippers of ghosts take birth amongst such beings, and My devotees come to Me alone.

Commentary
Devotees can only be elevated to the level of the entity they worship, just as water in a pipe can only rise to the level of the reservoir to which it is connected.  In this verse, Shree Krishna explains the implications of worshipping different entities by revealing the varieties of destinations attained.  He gives this knowledge to help us conclude that to reach the highest level of spiritual evolution we must worship the Supreme. 

The worshippers of Indra (the rain god), Surya (the sun god), Kuber (the god of wealth), Agni (the god of fire), etc. go to the celestial abodes.  Then, when their account of good karmas gets depleted, they are sent back from heaven.  The Pitars are the ancestors.  It is good to harbor thoughts of gratefulness toward them, but undue concern with their welfare is detrimental.  Those who engage in the ancestor worship go to the abodes of their ancestors after death. 

Those in the mode of ignorance worship ghosts and spirits.  In the Western world, there is witchcraft; in Africa, there is black magic; in India, there are vām-marg tāntrics, who invoke ghosts and spirits.  Shree Krishna says that persons who indulge in such things take birth amongst ghosts and spirits in their next life.

The highest devotees are those who attach their minds to the Supreme Divine Personality.  The word vrata means resolve and undertaking.  Such fortunate souls, who firmly resolve to worship God and engage steadfastly in His devotion, go to His divine Abode after birth.

patram—a leaf; puṣhpam—a flower; phalam—a fruit; toyam—water; yaḥ—who; me—to Me; bhaktyā—with devotion; prayachchhati—offers; tat—that; aham—I; bhakti-upahṛitam—offered with devotion; aśhnāmi—partake; prayata-ātmanaḥ—one in pure consciousness
Translation
BG 9.26: If one offers to Me with devotion a leaf, a flower, a fruit, or even water, I delightfully partake of that article offered with love by My devotee in pure consciousness.

Commentary
Having established the benefits of worshipping the Supreme, Shree Krishna now explains how easy it is to do so.  In the worship of the devatās and the ancestors, there are many rules to propitiate them, which must be strictly followed.  But God accepts anything that is offered with a loving heart.  If you have only a fruit, offer it to God, and He will be pleased.  If there is no fruit available, offer Him a flower.  If it is not the season for flowers, offer God a mere leaf; even that will suffice, provided it is a gift of love.  If leaves are also scarce, make an offering of water, which is available everywhere, but ensure again that you do it with devotion.  The word bhaktyā has been used in both the first and second lines of the verse.  It is the bhakti of the devotee that is pleasing to God, and not the worth of the offering.

By making this wonderful statement, Shree Krishna reveals the merciful divine nature of God.  He is not concerned with the material value of our offering.  Rather, He values, above everything else, the love with which we make the offering.  Thus, the Hari Bhakti Vilas states:

tulasī-dala-mātreṇa jalasya chulukena cha

vikrīṇīte svam ātmānaṁ bhaktebhyo bhakta-vatsalaḥ   (11.261)

“If you offer God with sincere love, just a Tulsī leaf and as much water as you can hold in your palm, He will offer Himself to you in return because He is endeared by love.”  How wonderful it is that the Supreme Master of unlimited universes, whose glorious qualities and virtues are amazing beyond description, and by whose mere thought multitudes of universes come into existence and disappear again, accepts even the most humble offering of His devotee that is given with genuine love.  The word used here is prayatātmanaḥ, implying, “I accept the offerings of those whose hearts are pure.”

The Shreemad Bhagavatam contains exactly the same verse as the above verse of the Bhagavad Gita.  While eating dry rice at the house of His friend, Sudama, Shree Krishna said:

patraṁ puṣhpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayachchhati

tadahaṁ bhaktyupahṛitam aśhnāmi prayatātmanaḥ   (10.81.4)

“If one offers Me with devotion, a leaf, a flower, a fruit, or even water, I delightfully partake of that article offered with love by My devotee in pure consciousness.”

Whenever God descends upon the earth, He exhibits this quality in His divine Pastimes.  Before the Mahabharat war, when Shree Krishna went to Hastinapur to explore the possibility of fashioning an agreement between the Kauravas and Pandavas, the evil Duryodhan had proudly prepared for Him a meal with fifty-six different items.  However, Shree Krishna rejected his hospitality and instead went to the humble hut of Vidurani, who had been longing deeply for the opportunity to serve her beloved Lord.  Vidurani was overjoyed on receiving the Supreme Lord at her home.  All she had to offer was bananas, but her intellect so benumbed with loving sentiments that she did not even realize she was dropping the fruit and putting the banana peels in His mouth.  Nevertheless, seeing her devotion, Shree Krishna blissfully ate the peels, as if they were the most delicious food in the world.

Translation
BG 9.27: Whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you offer as oblation to the sacred fire, whatever you bestow as a gift, and whatever austerities you perform, O son of Kunti, do them as an offering to Me.

Commentary
In the previous verse, Shree Krishna stated that all objects should be offered to Him.  Now He says that all actions should also be offered to Him.  Whatever social duties one may be engaged in, whatever vegetarian food one may be eating, whatever non-alcoholic beverages one may be drinking, whatever Vedic rites one may perform, whatever vows and austerities one may observe, should all be offered mentally to the Supreme Lord.  Very often, people separate devotion from their daily life, and look on it as something that is only to be performed inside the temple room.  However, devotion is not to be restricted to the periphery of the temple room; it is to be engaged in at every moment of our life. 

Sage Narad defines bhakti in this manner:

nāradastu tadarpitā khilāchāratā tadvismaraṇe paramavyākulateti

(Nārad Bhakti Darśhan, Sūtra 19)

“Devotion means offering your every activity to God, and feeling intense separation if ever you lose remembrance of Him.”  When works are dedicated and mentally delivered to God, it is called arpaṇam.  Such an attitude metamorphoses the mundane activities of material life into divine service of God.  Swami Vivekananda expressed this attitude toward work when he declared: “No work is secular.  Everything is devotion and service.”  Saint Kabir stated this in his couplet:

jahañ jahañ chalūñ karūñ parikramā, jo jo karūñ so sevā

jaba sovūñ karūñ daṇḍavat, jānūñ deva na dūjā

“Wherever I walk, I feel I am circumambulating the Lord’s temple; whatever I do, I see it as service to God.  When I go to sleep, I meditate on the sentiment that I am offering obeisance to God.  In this way, I remain ever united with Him.”  Without realizing its significance, many people say the following verse in temples:

kāyena vāchā manasendriyair vā buddhyātmanā vānusṛita-svabhāvāt

karoti yad yat sakalaṁ parasmai nārāyaṇāyeti samarpayet tat  

(Bhagavatam 11.2.36)

“Whatever one does with body, words, mind, senses, and intellect, in accordance with one’s individual nature, should be offered to the Supreme Lord Narayan.”  However, this act of offering is not to be done at the end of the work by merely reciting mantras, such as śhrī kṛiṣhṇāya samarpaṇam astu, etc., as is done in the Vedic rituals.  It is to be done while performing the action itself, by maintaining the consciousness that we are working for the pleasure of the Lord.  Having stated that all works should be offered to Him, Shree Krishna now lists the benefits of doing so.



====================================================================

śhubha aśhubha phalaiḥ—from good and bad results; evam—thus; mokṣhyase—you shall be freed; karma—work; bandhanaiḥ—from the bondage; sanyāsa-yoga—renunciation of selfishness; yukta-ātmā—having the mind attached to Me; vimuktaḥ—liberated; mām—to Me; upaiṣhyasi—you shall reach
Translation
BG 9.28: By dedicating all your works to Me, you will be freed from the bondage of good and bad results. With your mind attached to Me through renunciation, you will be liberated and will reach Me.

Commentary
Every action has defects, just as fire is covered by smoke.  When we walk on the earth, we unknowingly kill millions of tiny living entities.  In our occupational duties, no matter how careful we are in the fulfillment of our duties, we still end up harming the environment and hurting others.  Even if we eat a cup of yogurt, we still incur the sin of destroying the living entities that reside in it.  Some religious sects try to reduce this involuntary killing by tying a cloth over their mouth.  Even this does not fully eliminate the destruction of living entities in our breath. 

When we perform our actions with the intention of fulfilling our self-interest, we are culpable for the sins we commit, knowingly or unknowingly.  In accordance with the law of karma, we have to reap their karmic reactions.  Good works can also be binding because they oblige the soul to go to the celestial abodes to enjoy their results.  Thus, both bad and good karmas result in the continuity of the cycle of birth and death.   However, in this verse, Shree Krishna gives a simple solution for destroying all karmic reactions of work.  He uses the word sanyās yog, meaning renunciation of selfishness.  He says that when we dedicate our actions for the pleasure of the Lord, we are freed from the fetters of both good and bad results. 

Those who establish themselves in such consciousness are called yog yuktātmā (united in consciousness with God).  Such yogis become jīvan mukt (liberated in consciousness) even in this body.  And, upon leaving their mortal frame, they receive a divine body and eternal service in the divine Abode of God.

samaḥ—equally disposed; aham—I; sarva-bhūteṣhu—to all living beings; na—no one; me—to Me; dveṣhyaḥ—inimical; asti—is; na—not; priyaḥ—dear; ye—who; bhajanti—worship with love; tu—but; mām—Me; bhaktyā—with devotion; mayi—reside in Me; te—such persons; teṣhu—in them; cha—and; api—also; aham—I
Translation
BG 9.29: I am equally disposed to all living beings; I am neither inimical nor partial to anyone. But the devotees who worship Me with love reside in Me and I reside in them.

Commentary
We all intuitively believe that if there is a God, He must be perfectly just; there cannot be an unjust God.  People suffering injustice in the world make statements such as, “Mr. Billionaire, you have the power of money on your side. Do what you like.  God will settle our dispute.  He is watching and will definitely punish you.  You cannot escape.”  This sort of statement does not indicate that the person making it is a saint, possessing absolute faith in God, for even common persons believe that God is perfectly just. 

However, the previous verse by Shree Krishna creates the doubt that God is partial toward His devotees, because while everyone is subject to the law of karma, God releases His devotees from it.  Isn’t this symptomatic of the defect of partiality?  Shree Krishna feels it necessary to clarify this point and begins the verse by saying samo’ ham, meaning, “No, no, I am equal to all.  But I have a uniform law in accordance with which I bestow My grace.”  This law was previously stated in verse 4.11: “In whatever way people surrender to Me, I reciprocate with them accordingly.  Everyone follows My path in all respects, O son of Pritha.”

The rainwater falls equally upon the earth.  Yet, the drop that falls on the cornfields gets converted into grain; the drop that falls on the desert bush gets converted into a thorn; the drop that falls in the gutter becomes dirty water; and the drop that falls in the oyster becomes a pearl.  There is no partiality on the part of the rain, since it is equitable in bestowing its grace upon the land.  The raindrops cannot be held responsible for this variation in results, which are a consequence of the nature of the recipient.  Similarly, God states here that He is equally disposed toward all living beings, and yet, those who do not love Him are bereft of the benefits of His grace because their hearts are unsuitable vessels for receiving it.  So, what can people do whose hearts are impure?  Shree Krishna now reveals the purifying power of bhakti.

Translation
BG 9.30: Even if the vilest sinners worship Me with exclusive devotion, they are to be considered righteous, for they have made the proper resolve.

Commentary
Devotion to the Supreme Lord is so potent that it can reform even the vilest sinner.  In the scriptures, the classical examples of this are Ajamil and Valmiki, whose stories are commonly sung in all Indian languages.  Valmiki’s accumulated sins were so overbearing that he was unable even to enunciate “Ra..ma,” the two syllables in Lord Ram’s name.  His sins were preventing him from taking the divine Name.  So, his Guru thought of a way of engaging him in devotion by making him chant the reverse, “Ma Ra,” with the intention that repetition of “Mara Mara Mara Mara…” will automatically create the sound of “Rama Rama Rama…”  As a result, even such a sinful soul as Valmiki was reformed by the process of ananya bhakti (exclusive devotion) and transformed into a legendary saint. 

ulaṭā nāmu japata jagu jānā, bālmīki bhae brahma samānā.  (Ramayan)

“The whole world is testimony to the fact that the sinner Valmiki attained sainthood by chanting the syllables of God’s Name in the reverse order.”  Therefore, sinners are not condemned to eternal damnation.  On the strength of the transforming power of bhakti, Shree Krishna declares that even if the vilest sinners begin worshipping God exclusively, they should no longer be designated as sinners.  They have made a pure resolve and should thus be considered righteous due to their sublime spiritual intention.

kṣhipram—quickly; bhavati—become; dharma-ātmā—virtuous; śhaśhvat-śhāntim—lasting peace; nigachchhati—attain; kaunteya—Arjun, the son of Kunti; pratijānīhi—declare; na—never; me—My; bhaktaḥ—devotee; praṇaśhyati—perishes
Translation
BG 9.31: Quickly they become virtuous, and attain lasting peace. O son of Kunti, declare it boldly that no devotee of Mine is ever lost.

Commentary
How can devotees be considered venerable, merely for having made the correct resolve?  Shree Krishna explains that if they continue the process of exclusive devotion with unflinching faith in God, their hearts will become purified and they will swiftly develop saintly virtues. 

Divine virtues emanate from God Himself.  He is perfectly just, truthful, compassionate, loving, merciful, etc.  Since we souls are His tiny parts, we are all naturally drawn to these godly qualities.  But the process of becoming virtuous remains an elusive mystery.  From childhood, we have heard that we must speak the truth, serve others, be free from anger, etc. and yet we are unable to put those teachings into practice for the simple reason that our mind is impure.  Without purification of the mind, blemishes of character cannot be eradicated fully and permanently.  Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj declares the irrefutable truth regarding developing divine virtues:

satya ahinsā ādi mana! bina hari bhajana na pāya

jala te ghṛita nikale nahīñ, koṭina kariya upāya   (Bhakti Śhatak verse 35)

“Oil stains on a cloth cannot be removed by water, no matter how much we try.  Similarly, truthfulness, non-violence, and other virtuous qualities cannot be acquired without engaging in devotion to God.”  These qualities manifest when the mind is purified; and the purification of the mind cannot take place without attaching it to the all-pure God. 

Further, Shree Krishna asks Arjun to boldly declare that His devotees will never perish.  He does not say, “The jñānī (person of knowledge) will not be lost.”  Nor does He say, “The karmī (performer of rituals) shall not perish.”  He makes His promise for His bhaktas (devotees), saying that “they shall never come to ruin.”  Thereby, He reiterates what He had stated in verse 9.22, that He personally carries the burden of maintaining those who depend upon Him and engage in exclusive devotion unto Him.

It may seem intriguing why Shree Krishna asks Arjun to make this statement, instead of declaring it Himself?  The reason is that under special circumstances the Lord sometimes breaks His word, but He never permits His devotees’ word to be broken.  For example, Shree Krishna had resolved that He would not lift weapons during the Mahabharat war.  But when Bheeshma, considered the perfect devotee, resolved that he would either kill Arjun by sunset the next day or make the Lord lift weapons to protect him, Shree Krishna broke His own vow to protect the vow made by Bheeshma.  Thus, to reaffirm the strength of His statement, Shree Krishna here says, “Arjun, you declare that My devotee will never perish, for I shall guarantee that your word will be kept.”

Translation
BG 9.32: All those who take refuge in Me, whatever their birth, race, sex, or caste, even those whom society scorns, will attain the supreme destination.

Commentary
There are souls who have the good fortune of being born in pious families, where they are educated in good values and virtuous living from childhood.  This is a consequence of their good deeds in past lives.  Then, there are also souls who have the misfortune of being born in families of drunks, criminals, gamblers, and atheists.  This is also the result of sins committed in past lives. 

Here, Shree Krishna states that irrespective of birth, sex, caste, or race, whoever takes complete shelter of Him will attain the supreme goal.  Such is the greatness of the path of devotion that everyone is eligible for it, whereas in other paths there are strict criteria for eligibility. 

For the path of jñāna-yog, Jagadguru Shankaracharya states the eligibility:

vivekino viraktasya śhamādiguṇa śhalinaḥ

mukukṣhoraiva hi brahma jijñāsā yogyatā matāḥ

“Only those who possess the four qualifications—discrimination, detachment, disciplined mind and senses, and a deep yearning for liberation—are eligible for practicing the path of jñāna-yog.  

In the path of karm kāṇḍ (Vedic rituals), there are six conditions to be met:

deśhe kāle upāyena dravyaṁ śhraddhā samanvitam

pātre pradīyate yattat sakalaṁ dharma lakṣhaṇam

“Six criteria must be fulfilled for the fruition of ritualistic activities—the proper place, the correct time, the exact procedure and correct enunciation of mantras, utilization of pure materials, a qualified Brahmin who performs the yajña, and staunch faith in its efficacy.”

In the path of aṣhṭāṅg-yog as well, there are strict regulations:

śhuchau deśhe pratiṣhṭhāpya   (Bhagavatam 3.28.8)

“Perform haṭha-yog in a pure place, while seated immovably in the proper asan.”

In contrast, bhakti-yog is such that it can be done by anyone, at any time, place, and circumstance, and with any material.

na deśha niyamastasmin na kāla niyamasthathā   (Padma Purāṇ)

This verse states that God is not concerned with the time or place where we perform devotion.  He only sees the love in our heart.  All souls are the children of God, and He is willing to accept everyone with open arms, provided they come to Him with genuine love.”

किं पुनर्ब्राह्मणा: पुण्या भक्ता राजर्षयस्तथा |
अनित्यमसुखं लोकमिमं प्राप्य भजस्व माम् || 33||

kiṁ punar brāhmaṇāḥ puṇyā bhaktā rājarṣhayas tathā
anityam asukhaṁ lokam imaṁ prāpya bhajasva mām

kim—what; punaḥ—then; brāhmaṇāḥ—sages; puṇyāḥ—meritorius; bhaktāḥ—devotees; rāja-ṛiṣhayaḥ—saintly kings; tathā—and; anityam—transient; asukham—joyless; lokam—world; imam—this; prāpya—having achieved; bhajasva—engage in devotion; mām—unto Me
Translation
BG 9.33: What then to speak about kings and sages with meritorious deeds? Therefore, having come to this transient and joyless world, engage in devotion unto Me.

Commentary
When even the most abominable sinners are assured of success on the path of bhakti, then why should more qualified souls have any doubt?  Kings and sages should be even more reassured of attaining the supreme destination by engaging in ananya bhakti (exclusive devotion).  Shree Krishna thus beckons Arjun, “A saintly king like you should become situated in the knowledge that the world is temporary and a place of misery.  Engage yourself in steadfast devotion to Me, the possessor of unlimited eternal happiness.  Else the blessing of birth in a kingly and saintly family, good education, and favorable material circumstances will all be wasted, if they are not utilized in the pursuit of the supreme goal.”

मन्मना भव मद्भक्तो मद्याजी मां नमस्कुरु |
मामेवैष्यसि युक्त्वैवमात्मानं मत्परायण: || 34||

man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru
mām evaiṣhyasi yuktvaivam ātmānaṁ mat-parāyaṇaḥ

mat-manāḥ—always think of Me; bhava—be; mat—My; bhaktaḥ—devotee; mat—My; yājī—worshipper; mām—to Me; namaskuru—offer obeisances; mām—to Me; eva—certainly; eṣhyasi—you will come; yuktvā—united with Me; evam—thus; ātmānam—your mind and body; mat-parāyaṇaḥ—having dedicated to Me
Translation
BG 9.34: Always think of Me, be devoted to Me, worship Me, and offer obeisance to Me. Having dedicated your mind and body to Me, you will certainly come to Me.

Commentary
Having stressed bhakti, the path of devotion, throughout this chapter, Shree Krishna now concludes it by entreating Arjun to become His devotee.  He asks Arjun to unite his consciousness with God in true Yog, by worshipping Him, engaging the mind in meditation upon His divine form, and offering obeisance in pure humility to Him. 

Namaskuru (the act of humble obeisance) effectively neutralizes vestiges of egotism that may arise in the performance of devotion.  Thus, free from pride, with the heart immersed in devotion, one should dedicate all one’s thoughts and actions to the Supreme.  Shree Krishna assures Arjun that such complete communion with Him through bhakti-yog will definitely result in the attainment of God-realization; of this, there should be no doubt.
